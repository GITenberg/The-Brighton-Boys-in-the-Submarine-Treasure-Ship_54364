</div>


<p class="drop-cap">"LOOK, Dick, what's that out there in
the water right on the line of that
ventilator?"</p>

<p>Jay Thacker, ensign in the Navy of the
United States, veteran of many months' service
in the grand fleet of the American Admiral
Sims in European waters, grabbed his old
chum Dick Monaghan by the coat sleeve and
pointed a long lean finger out to the open
expanse of sea.</p>

<p>The two bronzed boys, rugged and fit after
their experiences of the Great War, erect and
sturdy looking in their natty uniforms, stood
on the aft deck of the giant <i>Leviathan</i>, United
States army transport, once the pride of the
German merchant marine, now a carrier of
men and merchandise sailing under the Stars
and Stripes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Homeward bound were they after two years'
service in the naval branch of their country's
armed forces. Once ordinary seamen Richard
Monaghan and Jay Thacker, back in the days
when they had left Brighton Academy on a
balmy spring morning to enlist in the Navy,
they were coming back Ensigns Monaghan
and Thacker, if you please! By virtue of
their splendid records while with the American
fleet, they had won the deserved promotions
that had brought them to their present rank.</p>

<p>Through many weary months they had
labored in the mine-sweeping section of the
fleet, alternating with the French and English
in clearing the North Sea of the deadly floating
bombs set adrift by the scions of the German
eagle, who sought thus to destroy those riding
battleships that had awaited all in vain the
coming out of the monster German fleet from
the safe retreat of the Kiel Canal. It had
been hard, tedious, dangerous work; work to
sorely try the nerve and patience of men
whose great desire had been to meet the Hun
in the open sea in a free-for-all fight.</p>

<p>But better things had remained in store for
these two valiant sons of Brighton who had
turned their backs on their dear old alma
mater to honor the call of their country. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
had been allotted to them, along with other
chosen men of the American fleet, to lay the
famous mine barrier across the northern
bottle of the North Sea&mdash;from the craggy
shores of Scotland to the embracing waters
of the Scandinavian countries. And it had
been a great day when the marvelous task had
been completed, but there followed a greater
day when the first of the German raiders had
run afoul of the mighty barrier and had been
"knocked for a goal" as Dick put it. What
a rejoicing when the President of the United
States and the Secretary of the Navy had
cabled the thanks of a grateful nation to every
last man in the fleet for this splendid bit of
service that had written a new chapter high
in the pages of Yankee naval history!</p>

<p>Now it was all over; the long days and
nights of untiring vigils, of tempestuous tussles
with the elements, and hard, unrelenting toil.
Back home now to the country they had left
in the long ago; to the old friends and familiar
places they had dreamed about in the monotony
of the long night hours at sea. Two years
away from home and dear old Brighton! The
hours dragged slowly while the great ship
<i>Leviathan</i> ploughed the deep with her cargo
of enlisted officers and men, now mustered out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of service and awaiting only the lowering of
the gangplank at Hoboken until they would
be back again in "civvies" and the comforts
of life again.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? I don't see anything,"
replied Dick in answer to his chum's
startled exclamation.</p>

<p>"Don't you see it&mdash;something sticking up
out of the water like a long spar, or an old
masthead of some sort?" continued Jay. He got
behind his chum now and pointed over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Dick peered more intently into the misty
haze that hung low over the horizon.</p>

<p>"Blamed if I can see anything, old pal,
except the blue expanse of water. Guess
maybe you are dreaming, or perhaps old man
Neptune, King of the Deep, has thrust one
of the prongs of his trident up through the
waves."</p>

<p>Monaghan guessed his old "bunkie" was
"seeing things."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," retorted Jay. "Now
look again, old top, just where I tell you to."
Thacker was positive he beheld some odd
object on the crest of the sea probably two
miles or more away.</p>

<p>As they looked together again their old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
friend Fismes, dancing at their feet on the
transport deck, manifested an interest in the
proceedings by setting up a raucous barking.
Good old Fismes! Once a mascot aboard a
German cruiser, he had been flung to the
embrace of old ocean's gray and melancholy
waste on a fateful day when one of the dandy
little American submarines, with a single sting
from its scorpion-like torpedo chamber, had
blown the Hun warship off the map of the
world. Swimming in the water, all but
exhausted, he had been picked up by the
American crew of which Thacker and Monaghan
were members. By right of their first
aid measures he had been allotted to the two
Brighton boys by common consent, and he,
too, was coming along to America as the most
treasured war trophy the two lads possessed.
Through all the long days Fismes had been a
close companion. Sleek and fat as a result
of good care and plentiful food, he was a
favorite among all the retiring service men.</p>

<p>"Keep still, Fismes; no more subs, old
boy," cautioned Jay, remembering how the
dog invariably had kicked up all kind of
canine didoes every time there had been a
likelihood of "going into action," after he
had "joined up" with Uncle Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you see it now?" asked Jay with a
show of impatience.</p>

<p>Dick was scanning the skyline intently.</p>

<p>"Sure, I get you, old man," he replied after
closer scrutiny of the water. "Now I see it,
sure as guns. About two points off the starboard
quarter. What in the world is it?" he
continued, shading his eyes with cupped hands
the better to focus on the object.</p>

<p>"Blamed if I know," answered Jay. "Wait
a minute. I'll run down to quarters and get
the glasses."</p>

<p>Off he dashed with Fismes at his heels,
leaving his chum standing at the rail. In a
moment he was back with a burnished pair of
binoculars which, once adjusted, he trained
on the floating object in the sea.</p>

<p>"Just what I doped it to be," affirmed Jay
after one long look. "A masthead bobbing
up and down in the water. Some old battered
hulk of a ship that has sailed its last long
voyage, sure as you are born."</p>

<p>Dick reached for the glasses. "Let's have
a look," he requested.</p>

<p>Jay extended the binoculars, and it took
only one hurried glance on the part of his chum
to corroborate the former's surmise.</p>

<p>"Guess you're right, pal," confirmed Dick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
"A derelict loose in the pathway of ocean
traffic. Some one of the vessels belonging to
the allied nations probably sunk by one of
the German submarines during the war. Gone
to her last resting-place in the salty brine."</p>

<p>After studying the derelict for several minutes
the two ensigns hurried off to the executive
officer of the <i>Leviathan</i> to report their
find. They found him, too, with glasses
examining the derelict.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir, but we thought perhaps
you hadn't seen it," said Jay deferentially.</p>

<p>The officer nodded a smiling assent. He
was busy taking the latitude and longitude of
the wreck to report to maritime quarters in New
York and London by wireless. No use stopping,
for nothing could be done; the derelict
would float until some salvage crew came to
blow it up or take it in tow&mdash;a menace to all
shipping traveling this way.</p>

<p>Back to the rail hurried the two young
officers, intent on studying the wreck as long
as it remained within vision. Their discussion
fell naturally into the number of grand old
ships that had gone down during the war&mdash;the
"wind-jammers" of earlier days, the sailing
craft that had been drafted for service in the
transportation of supplies, and the still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
modern steam craft&mdash;all of them victims of
the submarine's merciless hunger for tonnage
through four years of frenzied world war.</p>

<p>"Many gallant old ships down there under
the waves," remarked Jay as he peered
thoughtfully over the rail into the swirling
waters that were churned into a mad rapids
by the massive propeller blades of the <i>Leviathan</i>.</p>

<p>Dick slung the glasses over his shoulder and
fell into the speculative mood of his old
Brighton roommate.</p>

<p>"Right you are, Jay; good old ships of the
line that have anchored for the last time on
the bottom of the sea. Imbedded in silt or
wasting away on their rocky beds. Gone but
not forgotten."</p>

<p>Jay stirred from his revery.</p>

<p>"Not so sure about that 'gone but not forgotten'
stuff," was his observation. "Science
will never let all those ships stay there for
keeps&mdash;not on your tin cup. Think of all the
ships sunk! Think of the billions of cargo
that went down with them&mdash;billions of dollars'
worth of valuable stuff of all kinds."</p>

<p>"Yes, and most of it perishable like foodstuffs,
grain and the like that by this time
has crumbled into decay deep down in Davy
Jones' locker," broke in Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know," continued Jay, "but how
about all the coal that could be reclaimed?
Think of the ores and the steel and the guns
and shells and stuff like that; they would still
be good should they ever be reclaimed. And
oh, boy, think of all the gold bullion and the
silver and all the priceless stuff that's still as
good as the day it first saw the rays of the
sun. Man alive!"</p>

<p>Jay's eyes sparkled at the thought of the
treasure deep down in the fathoms&mdash;ransoms
big enough to buy whole countries of the
earth!</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but how you going to get it
up?" interrogated Dick. Conservative old
Dick! He was figuratively from Missouri, and
had to be shown any proposition in cold facts
and figures before he would dive in&mdash;except
when it was an order of duty. Then he was
Johnny-on-the-spot with all his heart and soul,
wherever duty took him.</p>

<p>"Get wise to yourself," counseled Jay,
throwing his arm affectionately about his
chum's shoulders. "You know as well as I
do that it's possible; that salvagers can wrest
a big bunch of that good old mazuma from
'Pop' Neptune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>"You ought to know; you've seen for yourself how it can be done," went on Jay at a
rapid rate.</p>

<p>Both boys had, indeed, had sufficient experience
under the water to acquaint them with
the fundamentals of deep-sea salvage. While
serving with the Yankee fleets abroad, particularly
in the laying of the North Sea mine
wall, they had taken many a dip in diving
armor below the surface of the sea. True, it
had not been in the exploration of sunken
ships or the reclamation of submerged cargoes;
but their long, hard hours "down below"
while adjusting mine screens and bombs had
qualified them as first class divers in the
strictest sense of the word.</p>

<p>"Sure, I know; I was only kidding. I
just wanted to see what you would say," was
Dick's rejoinder. But while he was convinced
that nonperishable cargoes could be reclaimed,
he was inclined to be skeptical about the raising
of sunken ships.</p>

<p>"Well, you just wait, old pal, and see what
Uncle Sam, Johnny Bull, and the rest of them
do," argued Jay. "They are raising the Hun
warships in Scapa Flow right now, and pretty
soon you'll see them go after all the cargo
ships that lie in shallow water. I'll wager
you an apple against a swell feed at the Astor
those Germans are out after them already."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon you are right," put in Dick after
a moment's reflection.</p>

<p>"And as for me, I'd like nothing better
than to ship with a salvage crew this summer
until Brighton opens in the fall." Jay said
it with a broad grin.</p>

<p>Dick surveyed his chum for a moment,
looking full in his eyes.</p>

<p>"On the level?" he queried rather incredulously.</p>

<p>"Nothing would strike me better&mdash;action
for mine," snapped Jay. "Holy smoke!
think of the chance to stock up on some big
coin! If a fellow got in right he could lay
away enough to finish at Brighton and go on
to college. I'd go in a minute if the chance
developed."</p>

<p>Like a flash the whole picture opened up to
Dick&mdash;an opportunity to use the experience
they had gained in the Navy to rake in some
good honest "kale" during the summer recess.</p>

<p>"Dad burn it! Hanged if I wouldn't go in
myself," came his convincing reply as he thrust
his arm into the arm of his chum and set off
across decks in answer to the evening mess call.</p>

<p>The chance to reclaim lost treasure measured
in millions from the very bottom of the
sea&mdash;something that Jules Verne had only
pictured.</p>

<span class="ch">"Down with the Reds!"</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">"COME on, Fismes, old boy; you've
been with us in more than one pinch
and saw us safely through," called
Jay a few mornings later to the famous dog of
war that he and Dick Monaghan had brought
home with them from the North Sea.</p>

<p>Ensigns Thacker and Monaghan, home less
than a week, were losing no time. It was only
three months until the opening of Brighton
Academy for the fall term, and both lads were
keen on getting back again to finish their preparatory
school courses. A job! That was
what they wanted. The chance to earn a few
dollars that would go a long way toward seeing
them through their final year at Brighton.</p>

<p>Jay was a fatherless lad whose dad had lost
his life some years previously in the big shipyard
that was one of the major industries of
the hustling New England city of Bridgeford.
His mother had been able to make things go
by reason of a small English estate left her by
an aunt, together with an allowance provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
by the shipbuilding company. An only sister
had made ready money during the war in the
central offices. Jay had helped work his way
through three years at Brighton and was all
set on a college career.</p>

<p>His chum, Dick Monaghan, came of a family
of moderate means. Neither lad was averse
to good honest toil, and invariably spent the
summer recess between school years working
in the shipyards at one job or another. Tall,
well-built as a result of their athletic training
on the football field and in the "gym" at
Brighton, they could stack up against the
toughest kind of work and get away with it.</p>

<p>Back from war, without funds except for the
final pay-off, they were out again for a summer
job. The home-coming had been a
joyous reunion; hearty handshakes, reminiscences
of the long campaign and a friendly succession
of "Good work, boys," and "We're
proud of you." But the job was now the
thing&mdash;and the sooner the better for this pair.</p>

<p>"Come on, Fismes, you'll have to help us
put this over," sang out Dick, as he swung
alongside his chum, and together they set their
faces toward the waterfront, with the dog tagging
along at their heels.</p>

<p>"Think we'll have any trouble horning in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
again at the old works," suggested Dick as
they elbowed their way along, bowing to various
friends whom they chanced to pass.</p>

<p>"Well, they've been laying some of the
hands off, according to what I hear," answered
Jay. "However, there's no telling until we
try; there may be a chance for a couple of
retired seadogs."</p>

<p>"Here's hoping," was Dick's optimistic
sally.</p>

<p>Soon they were in sight of the familiar old
shipyard; the giant steel-framed shipways
looming against the sky like monster spider
webs; the throbbing rat-tat-tat of the riveting
machines borne into their ears with a haunting
familiarity.</p>

<p>"Just the same as ever, kiddo," laughed
Jay, as he turned to his chum.</p>

<p>"Only bigger and busier than ever finishing
up contracts," came the reply.</p>

<p>They were edging toward the main gate,
when some one came hurrying up behind and
literally threw himself upon the two lads.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be horn-swaggled if it ain't me
good old buddies Jay Thacker and Dick Monaghan,"
came the precipitous cry. "Mit me,
boys, I'm tickled to death to see you all again."</p>

<p>Turning, the Brighton boys found themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
face to face with their old friend, Larry
Seymour, one of their old Bridgeford crowd
who had gone away into the army early in the
war. Larry, the life of the party, who could
find fun in a funeral and keep things stirring
all the time.</p>

<p>"Hello, Larry," the chums exclaimed in
unison, fairly hugging the newcomer. It had
been more than two years since they had last
met. And what a lot had happened! Larry
was in overalls and begrimed with all the firsthand
evidences of toil.</p>

<p>"Working in the yard?" asked Dick after
the hand-pumping had subsided and they had
told somewhat in hurried detail where they
had been and what they had been doing since
last they were together.</p>

<p>"Am I working? Say, bo, if rivets was
railroad spikes I'd have built a line to Mars
by way of Venus and all around to the moon
again," was the bantering reply.</p>

<p>"Think we can land a job again?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>"Aces beat deuces every time, fellows," was
Larry's somewhat flippant reply. "If you
guys can't get a job at the works again then
the figure of Justice in the courthouse has lost
the scales she's been carrying in her good
right fist all these years."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick and Jay were absorbing some of the
optimism of their stout-hearted old friend.
They had been a bit dubious about being able
to get a job right away; and time meant a
whole lot when it was only ninety days or so
until the opening of Brighton.</p>

<p>"Montey Brown still boss of the yard?"
queried Jay of the newcomer. He referred to
Montague Brown, who for years had been
yard superintendent of Bridgeford's bustling
shipbuilding industry. Brown had told the
boys when they went away into the service
that their old jobs would be ready for them.</p>

<p>"Bet your life he's still around," was Larry's
reassuring reply, to which he added, somewhat
facetiously: "Montey couldn't be pried away
from Bridgeford Yard by all the king's horses
and all the king's men."</p>

<p>In lightning style Seymour traced the activities
of the old workshop during the period of
his re-employment following the expiration of
his army term. During the war, it appeared,
the yard had sailed serenely along, turning out
new tonnage at a record-breaking clip, particularly
vessels and equipment for the United
States Navy.</p>

<p>Since the armistice there had come a change
over the works. The places of hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
men who had gone out into the service had
been taken for the most part by workmen of
foreign birth. Many of them illiterate and
unappreciative of American freedom, they had
fallen easy prey to the radical labor leaders
who had sprung up within the works like mushrooms
growing overnight.</p>

<p>Preaching the doctrines of the Russian Reds,
these extremists in economic thought had sown
discord among the rank and file of the men,
particularly the foreigners, preaching the dictatorship
of the proletariat, which meant that
the men who work with their hands must be
the masters. Jay and Dick heard to their
surprise that during the time the brave boys of
America had been offering their services, their
very lives, for their country, these Bolshevists
had been openly plotting against the whole
republican plan of American life.</p>

<p>"Secret meetings, wild speeches and all
kinds of goings on," muttered Larry. "All
the time talking about strikes and walkouts,
and even threatening among themselves to
take over the whole blamed works and run 'em
themselves."</p>

<p>To the two naval veterans, who had always
shared a distinctive pride in the big shipyard,
this seemed an incredible state of affairs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
laborers who had enjoyed fancy wages during
the time of the war while millions of loyal
Americans were serving abroad now fanning
the flames of industrial revolution!</p>

<p>"Looks like there was lots more good work
cut out for us fellows right here at home," was
Dick's rather caustic comment.</p>

<p>"You bet your life there is, and we are
getting back on the job just in time so far as
I can see," was Larry's rejoinder, as he went
on to relate some of the later developments in
the yard's labor situation. Only the previous
night, it appeared, the strike leaders, in a
long and noisy meeting, had decided to submit
their claims forthwith for a seven-hour day
and a forty percent increase in wages.</p>

<p>"Things are likely to open up right lively
then on a moment's notice," remarked Dick.</p>

<p>"No telling when and what them bullshevicks
is liable to pull off," offered Seymour.</p>

<p>By now the trio had arrived before the main
gate of the yard. Old Bill Cavanaugh, the
veteran watchman, recognized the two Brighton
boys in an instant and gave them a
hearty welcome. No need for a pass here,
since no more popular boys had ever passed
the gate than Dick and Jay. Fismes, too,
got by with a wag of his tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, what's this," whistled Larry, as he
directed attention across the yard to an open
space fronting the administration building.
Three or four score men, riggers, riveters,
yard laborers of all kinds, were swaying to
and fro around one who seemed buffeted about
like a huge cork in a mountain brook. Loud
cries, angry voices, mingled oaths and the
strident tones of inflamed speakers rent the
air. They seemed to be venting their anger
on the lone figure in the midst of the turbulent
group.</p>

<p>"Looks like a sure enough riot," surmised
Dick.</p>

<p>The three youths came to a dead stop eager
to get a line on what was going on and to
make out if possible what it was all about.</p>

<p>"Let's move up closer and get an earful,"
suggested Dick. At once the trio headed
across the yard toward the scene of trouble.</p>

<p>"Likely more of this Red stuff," Seymour
was saying. Hardly had the words escaped
his lips before the demonstration, indeed,
became a regular riot. With one accord, it
seemed, the crowd closed in upon the beleaguered
one in their midst. Louder and louder
grew their voices. Cries of "Punch the stiff!"
and "Soak him!" could be heard at this distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looks like rough stuff here, boys," cried
Dick, alarmed at the antics of the crowd and
fearful for the fate of the lone figure whose
face was lost in the pack of swirling humanity.</p>

<p>"And just about time that we took a hand
in it; what do you say, boys?" came Jay's
response.</p>

<p>"With you all the way," replied the other
two.</p>

<p>Suiting action to words, Jay broke into a
run, closely followed by Dick and Larry, with
Fismes flying at their heels, barking furiously.</p>

<p>Like a flying wedge the trio of sturdy war
veterans descended upon the wrangling mob.
Coming closer, the boys found the central figure
in the mass now defending himself against
clenched fists that were reaching out from
every direction, trying to land blows on his
face and body. He was a stalwart man of
middle age who was hammering back blow
for blow now against the heavy odds pressing
against him.</p>

<p>"Into them, fellows; lay it on thick,"
yelled Jay as he flung himself on the outer
rim of rioters.</p>

<p>Bang! Biff! Crack! Three flying figures,
two of them in the uniform of the Navy, the
third in blue, begrimed overalls, waded into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the mass before them. Right and left they
swung on their opponents, a snarling canine
at their heels leaping with them into the
midst of the mêlée.</p>

<p>"Give it to them, fellows," roared Larry
above the tumult as he laid out a greasy
looking six-foot brute with a right uppercut
under the chin, and followed suit with a
smashing solar plexus on the abdomen of
another towering belligerent.</p>

<p>In another moment the fighting trio had
cleaved a lane clear through the rioters to the
side of that one lone figure who was still standing
his ground. One swarthy and bewhiskered
rioter who seemed to be the leader of the workmen
was pummeling his victim with smashing
blows.</p>

<p>"This for you," bellowed Jay as he let loose
with a terrific right arm swing full in the face.
Down he went with a grunt of rage. Jay
leaped to get another of the ring-leaders, but
ere he landed the furry figure of a great dog
flashed through the air, full upon Jay's intended
victim. With a snarl of rage the
animal set his teeth in the left leg of the
surprised foreigner.</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Fismes," cried Dick, as he
closed with another antagonist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The fight lasted not more than a minute.
Two bronzed navy veterans, an ex-soldier with
a fine record and a good old dog who had sense
enough to stick with his friends against any
odds&mdash;they were more than a match for a
bunch of rioting strikers. Back fell the crowd
before the fierce onslaught, scattering right
and left, but not quick enough to evade the
mounted shipyard police who came up on the
gallop, swinging riot clubs with telling effect.</p>

<p>With their backs to the rescued, the rescuers
stood their ground until order had been
restored. Only then did they turn to the
man they had saved against the wrath of the
mob.</p>

<p>"Well, of all things, our old friend Montey
Brown," cried Jay in surprise, recognizing at
once the yard superintendent!</p>

<p>"Jay Thacker! And Dick Monaghan! Did
you ever? And Larry Seymour," exclaimed
the veteran official, bruised and battered, but
smiling through it all.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER III
<span class="ch">Signed Up for Salvage</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">"BY George! that was a narrow call for
me," vouchsafed Brown, the yard
superintendent, to the three rescuers,
whom he had invited into his office following
the tilt with the crowd of rioters. His face a
mass of bruises, poor old Montey presented a
sorry spectacle.</p>

<p>"But for you fellows, to say nothing of this
bully good dog of war of yours, things might
have gone bad for me," he continued, still
somewhat out of breath. "I'm deeply indebted
to you chaps and feel I never can
repay you."</p>

<p>The boys bowed modestly and asked the
old "super" to tell them what it all was about.</p>

<p>A truculent delegation of the so-called
"Reds," it appeared, had awaited the superintendent
just outside his office, prepared to
present their inordinate demands. Led by
their more rabid leaders they had presented
what was virtually an ultimatum, and finally
had become menacing when Brown told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
he would have to lay the whole proposition
before the management.</p>

<p>"We want an answer right now or we will
start something," was their nasty reply. And
as the superintendent had turned to make his
way back into his offices they had closed in
on him. One hot-headed belligerent had
started the fireworks with a well-aimed blow,
and then followed the riot.</p>

<p>"But now it's all over and I have to thank
you boys for your game stand against such
odds," he concluded. In turn the superintendent
quizzed the boys about where they
had been and what they had been doing these
last two years. He listened attentively to
Jay's modest statement of facts, being particularly
interested in the description of how
the Americans had laid the mine curtain across
the North Sea.</p>

<p>"You both have had experience at deep-sea
diving, haven't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>The boys replied affirmatively, Dick adding
some details.</p>

<p>"And I reckon you are both after jobs for
the summer, aren't you?" he asked again after
learning that Jay and Dick expected to return
to Brighton in the fall.</p>

<p>"You're right," they replied together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you chaps come back to see me again
day after to-morrow&mdash;nine o'clock in the
morning right here in this office," said the
superintendent. "I think I will have something
at that time that may interest you," he
added.</p>

<p>The boys promised to be on hand at the
designated time and were quite overjoyed at
the prospect of something doing so soon&mdash;and
right from the boss himself, too.</p>

<p>"You might come along, too, Larry," the
official turned to Seymour. "You sure gave
me a boost just when I most needed it, and
I reckon you are fit enough company for this
particular project I have in mind."</p>

<p>Larry eagerly accepted and said he certainly
would be on deck. In a few minutes the trio
withdrew from the private office, and once
outside gave themselves over to all manner of
speculation as to what the big boss had in
mind.</p>

<p>"It must be something good the way he
talked," began Dick.</p>

<p>"And whatever it is I'm in on it, for what
Montey Brown goes in for anytime anywhere
is sure to be a first-class proposition," added
Jay.</p>

<p>Larry was so happy over the turn of events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he grabbed Fismes to him and gave the dog
such a hug that the animal gasped.</p>

<p>It was agreed they would meet outside the
superintendent's office on the designated morning
at five minutes before nine o'clock. Then
the trio separated, Larry going back to his
work on the ways and Dick and Jay adjourning
uptown to mingle among some old friends
and, among other things, to lay in new "civvies."
The naval uniforms were to be laid
aside as precious mementoes of the war.</p>

<p>The two Brighton boys found themselves
heroes before the day was over. When the
afternoon papers came out on the street they
contained two-column double-leaded accounts
of the riot at the shipyard and of the spectacular
part played by two navy veterans in the
rescue of the yard superintendent. Everywhere
they went they were hailed with a
hearty welcome and given the glad hand.</p>

<p>"Gosh, this is awful," moaned Jay after an
old resident had nearly wrung his hand off
with a demonstrative felicitation.</p>

<p>"I'd sooner set mines in the deepest water
than face much of this kind of music," wailed
Dick in return.</p>

<p>The two boys could scarcely contain themselves
until the appointed hour when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
were to meet Superintendent Brown in the
works. The nearly forty-eight hours dragged
by slowly for the youths who in their eagerness
to find out what it was all about were
down at the yard two days later a half hour
before the appointed time.</p>

<p>"Medals or mischief, whatever it is, here
we go," snorted Larry, the irrepressible, as he
joined the group. He was in working togs.</p>

<p>Just at nine o'clock they sent in their names
and were promptly admitted to the private
office of the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Good morning, boys, I see you are out
bright and early, and all set for the big game,"
began that official.</p>

<p>"At your service, sir," answered Jay.</p>

<p>At one side of the superintendent's big desk
sat a grizzled old chap who had all the earmarks
of a salt-sea captain of a matured
vintage&mdash;side whiskers, smooth brown skin
and steely blue eyes that twinkled with
merriment.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I want you to meet Captain
Dwight Austin, whom I will further identify
a little later," said Brown indicating the fifth
man in the room. Deferentially the latter got
to his feet and shook hands all around with a
crisp "Glad to meet you, boys."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Brown indicated chairs and bade the boys
be seated.</p>

<p>"I have a proposition to make," he offered
by way of introduction. "It may not appeal
to you, and on the other hand it may."</p>

<p>Drawing his chair closer to the table and
surveying his auditors intently, the superintendent
launched into his subject.</p>

<p>"You all know that during the big war
many valuable ships were sent to the bottom
of the sea by the German U-boats, and that
with them went precious cargoes of all kinds
measured in wealth that can hardly be estimated.
Many of these ships went down in
shallow water, where they lie to-day awaiting
the time when reconstructive men of all
nations can set about the reclamation of this
vast treasure that awaits them in the embrace
of the briny deep."</p>

<p>Jay and Dick glanced quickly at each other,
recalling on the instant how only a few days
ago they had discussed the same subject on
the deck of the <i>Leviathan</i> while observing a
floating derelict.</p>

<p>"I want to take you all into my confidence
at this time," the superintendent was saying,
"and if what I have to say does not interest
you I must bind you to silence and ask that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
you say nothing of the matter to anyone. I
trust you implicitly and feel that you will
gladly acquiesce in the matter."</p>

<p>The three lads eagerly agreed to abide by
the will of the old yard boss.</p>

<p>"All right, then," he went on. "Coming
right down to brass tacks, our company is
organizing a salvage company to go out after
some of these lost ships and their cargoes.
We have come into some new and original
methods of stalking lost maritime game and
have proved these processes by some very
satisfactory experiments. Beyond all doubt
we are in a position to say that the reclamation
of millions of dollars' worth of lost cargoes,
to say nothing of the raising of the ships, is a
feasible proposition. Not only is it feasible,
but we are about ready now to send forth our
first salvage ship."</p>

<p>Jay stirred in his chair. It was the fulfillment
of his hazy dream&mdash;the groping for lost
ships on the bottom of the sea and the exploration
of their battered hulls!</p>

<p>"What we want to do is to prove to the
government that our ship salvage facilities are
all that we claim for them," explained Brown.
"It is our purpose to go out and work first
on several ships that we have in mind right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
here on the Atlantic coast. Once we have
demonstrated what we can do, we hope to
take on government contracts under government
auspices. It is all as clear as crystal
in our minds."</p>

<p>The superintendent paused for a moment
while he lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>"What I have in mind for you fellows is
this," he added. "How would you like to
ship aboard this first treasure ship of ours?
I understood that you, Thacker, and you, too,
Monaghan, had considerable experience diving
over there in the North Sea."</p>

<p>The boys nodded their assent.</p>

<p>"Good enough," replied the official. "You
are just the kind of men we are looking for.
Good experienced divers. We know how well
Uncle Sam trains them. As for you, Seymour,
you proved your courage the other day, and
while you may have had no diving experience
we have a place for you. What do you say,
boys? The pay will be many times anything
you have ever earned in one summer. Go out
there into that anteroom and talk it over for
a few minutes."</p>

<p>The boys jumped to their feet with alacrity
and followed the shipping official into the
adjoining room. There, left to themselves,
they plunged into the subject with vim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think of that? Just what
I was talking about the other day!" chirruped
Jay as he whacked his chum over the shoulder.
Dick was all smiles.</p>

<p>"Looks like a good thing to me&mdash;a peach
of a chance, I should say." For once, at
least, Dick had readily thrown all his conservatism
to the wind.</p>

<p>"What about you, Larry?" asked Jay,
turning to the third member of the trio.</p>

<p>"Lead me to it, gentlemen, lead me to it;
but pinch me quick, for I sure think I'm
dreaming," piped Larry in his inimitable style.</p>

<p>The three youths were in high glee. The
chance for adventure, to say nothing of the
wonderful remuneration that the job would
hold. In less time than it takes to tell they
had filed back into the superintendent's office
and reported their decision.</p>

<p>"Fine business," said the delighted superintendent.
"And now let me introduce again
Captain Dwight Austin, skipper of the good
ship <i>Nemo</i>, the first salvage ship turned out
at the Bridgeford Yard. If you boys are in
earnest, report to Captain Austin to-morrow
morning at 7.30 at the Emerson wharf. I
need not add that I am very well pleased with
your decision and wish you all kinds of luck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in your work for the summer. I don't think
you will regret what you have done."</p>

<p>In high glee the three youths piled out of
the office after affixing their names to the
roster of the ship's crew.</p>

<p>As they bolted down the stairs and turned
into the hallway leading to the exit Jay ran
full into a strapping big fellow of brawny
build, with shaggy eyebrows and scowling face,
who was shuffling along in an unsteady gait.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, I didn't see you
coming," said Jay apologetically, as he stepped
aside.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, stupid?
Can't you watch where you're goin'?" was the
gruff answer.</p>

<p>Jay insisted it had all been an accident.</p>

<p>"Keep out of my way hereafter," bellowed
the other. "If you don't&mdash;this for you."
And he pushed Jay full in the face with his
flat dirty hand.</p>

<p>In an instant Jay's blood was boiling.</p>

<p>"I apologized to you, but I guess what you
need is a lesson in politeness," was his cool
retort as he stepped up close and surveyed the
bully in the eye.</p>

<p>For answer the obstreperous rowdy made a
pass for the Brighton boy's face with clenched
fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Quick as a flash Jay parried the thrust with
his left and shot over a powerful right hand
swing&mdash;the kind he had planted on the rioters.
It caught the bully flush on the point of the
jaw&mdash;a clean smash that sent him sprawling
on the floor. His honor requited, Jay stepped
back to survey the damage he had done.</p>

<p>Half dazed from the punch and muttering to
himself, the bully struggled to his feet and
picked up his hat.</p>

<p>"All right, smarty; I'll get you sometime
alone when your crowd ain't with you," he
stuttered and edged away sheepishly.</p>

<p>It had happened so quickly Dick and Larry
hardly knew what it was all about. Jay
explained the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Serves him right," said Dick. "The world
is full of fellows nowadays who think they can
ride roughshod over everybody. They need
to be put in their places and realize that
human rights belong to all the people instead
of a few."</p>

<p>The incident was soon forgotten in the
planning for the morrow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER IV
<span class="ch">On the Golden Trail</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IMAGINE the surprise of the boys the next
morning when they appeared at the Emerson
wharf to report to Captain Austin to
find a trim little submarine craft hugging the
quay, her hatches open forward and aft to
admit her crew, the exhaust of her gasoline
engines fluttering from the rear.</p>

<p>"Must be some mistake here; I never knew
they explored the bottom of the sea from a
submarine," exclaimed Dick in some surprise.</p>

<p>The boys had expected to find some craft
of an altogether different nature. The submarine
was a new one on them.</p>

<p>"It's the <i>Nemo</i>, all right," said Jay, pointing
out the name of the vessel on the prow.</p>

<p>Captain Austin was standing near the conning
tower directing various members of the
crew as they prepared to cast off and head
out of the harbor.</p>

<p>"Good morning, boys, come right aboard,"
he called out, noting the arrival of the new
members of his crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Jay and Dick were soon on deck chatting
with their captain, noting that Larry Seymour
had already arrived. The three boys were
assigned to the diving work exclusively and
so had nothing to do with the navigation of
the craft. In turn Captain Austin introduced
the new arrivals to other divers aboard.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Weddigen&mdash;Carl Weddigen&mdash;also
a new man," said the captain as a huge
hulk of a fellow lurched forward when his turn
came.</p>

<p>Jay was almost too dumbfounded to speak.
The fellow facing him was none other than the
big bully he had knocked down the previous
afternoon in the corridor of Superintendent
Brown's office.</p>

<p>Weddigen backed away, refusing to extend
his hand.</p>

<p>Jay smiled. "I guess we have met before,"
he remarked dryly.</p>

<p>Dick and Larry were on the point of bursting
into a hearty guffaw, but restrained themselves.</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" asked the amazed ship
captain, noting how Weddigen was reddening.</p>

<p>"I guess Mr. Weddigen can speak for himself,"
was Jay's only answer, not wishing to
create a scene right at the outset of the new
adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that's rather extraordinary," began
the captain.</p>

<p>"Just a little unpleasantness that we had
yesterday," added Jay, "But we'll forget it
now for the good of the cause."</p>

<p>"I hope things will be all right, for he is a
very fine diver, according to my information,
and can stand a lot with his big physique, so
I am told," explained the captain.</p>

<p>"The matter's a closed incident so far as I
am concerned," offered Jay. And so the incident
was closed, except for knowing glances
exchanged among the newest additions to the
ship's personnel.</p>

<p>Soon the <i>Nemo</i> had backed away from her
moorings and was headed out into Long Island
Sound, the most of the divers and those members
of the crew not actually engaged in the
ship's navigation standing out on deck in
enjoyment of the balmy spring morning.</p>

<p>"I guess you would not be averse to knowing
something about this craft," began Captain
Austin after a half hour's run. He had
strolled forward to where Jay, Dick and Larry
were watching the backwash of the water as
the steel prow of the <i>Nemo</i> sliced its way
forward with knife-like precision.</p>

<p>Indeed they would! The three veterans of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the war, two of whom had quite a fund of
submarine knowledge from their own experiences
abroad, were wondering what the <i>Nemo</i>
was like. Was it possible that the submersible
was a diving bell from which divers could
make their exit while it lay on the ocean bed?
Were trap doors opened and the pressure of
sea water held in abeyance by dense volumes
of compressed air? Or did divers go down
from the deck of the submarine just as from
any other craft? If so, why the submarine,
with its narrow, cramped quarters, in preference
to any other type of vessel?</p>

<p>These were some of the questions flitting
through their minds as they embarked on their
first treasure-hunting voyage.</p>

<p>The whole thing was soon to be unfolded by
Captain Austin.</p>

<p>"With this craft we do most of our locating,"
he began. "By that I mean that we
are here equipped with special apparatus for
finding the lost ships. Many a salvaging
company has found that it is one thing to
explore a sunken ship or even raise it, but
quite another thing to actually locate the
submerged ship. It is one thing to know the
approximate position where a ship has been
sunk, but another thing to know the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
spot. Some charts may give you the exact
spot where a ship has foundered, but this
spot may measure five miles or more, and if
the ship is located in any channel or such
parts of the ocean where there is an undertow
or heavy undercurrents, the ship will soon be
covered with sand, moss or barnacles, and
hard for divers to locate."</p>

<p>Plainly, this new salvage company must
have some new method of finding ships all
their own. The boys were keenly interested
and awaiting eagerly the explanation.</p>

<p>"There are several ways to locate lost
ships," resumed Captain Austin. "Divers
can be sent down with powerful flashlights,
but this is a lengthy procedure, and very often
takes weeks of patient search. Then again,
grappling irons or anchors may be dragged
from the salvage ship. This is even less
satisfactory than sending down divers. But
the Bridgeford Company has a new scheme
all its own. And now you shall see."</p>

<p>The <i>Nemo's</i> captain climbed into the turret
and motioned the boys to follow him below
deck. Dropping straight down into the heart
of the ship the boys followed the captain into
a small compartment that he was pleased to
style "the listening post."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"In here we listen for lost ships just as
you listen for the voice of a friend over the
telephone. How does that strike you?"</p>

<p>While in the Navy Jay and Dick had come
to know only too well how the microphone
was used to hear other vessels, and how it
had been a powerful means in the overthrow
of the U-boats and the safeguarding of American
troops bound for Europe. The microphone
listened for moving vessels and was
acquainted with their movements because the
swish of the propeller blades was borne into
the listening device of the Yankee craft.</p>

<p>But how could a salvage ship "listen" for a
helpless wreck lying foundered on the bottom
of the sea? They were soon to know. Captain
Austin conducted them first into the
forward hold and showed them another compartment
with a massive winch used to raise
or lower an object in the water under the keel.
Taking them aft he showed another compartment
equipped as was the one forward.</p>

<p>"We use the so-called Hughes balance,"
explained the skipper as the boys gathered
close to him in order to hear above the whirr
of the throbbing engines. "They are two
massive rings suspended by cables and raised
or lowered at will by the winches. These rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
or cups are wound with copper wire. The
lower windings connect with an ordinary telephone
receiver while other spools are in series
with a microphone and three dry cells. This
makes a sensitive instrument."</p>

<p>Dick, who was somewhat of a mechanic, was
beginning to see light.</p>

<p>"When these induction coils are trailed
through the water from underneath the <i>Nemo</i>
the telephone receiver in the control station
gives no sound as long as the two balances
move through the water," continued the
captain. "But the minute one of them comes
within the vicinity of a wreck, the electrical
balance will be disturbed and the telephone
will sound its warning to the operator. The
nearer the balances come to the wreck the
louder the sound. All you have to do is cruise
back and forth near the spot where the sunken
vessel is supposed to lie, and sooner or later
the faithful induction balance will find the
wreck."</p>

<p>"How do you judge for the depth?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>"The depth of the ocean naturally varies
more or less," the captain explained further.
"If a deeper strata is encountered the induction
balances must be lowered further in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
water than in cruising in shallow water. Not
only will the induction balance give the exact
spot where the ship is located, but it will give
the precise location even though the lost ship
is covered with sand or silt."</p>

<p>"But how do you determine the depth?
Do you drop a plumb line, or have you a new
method of depth sounding?" persisted Dick,
who was taking an engineering course at
Brighton preparatory to studying electrical
engineering at college. Naturally he was
interested in every engineering problem.</p>

<p>Captain Austin smiled whimsically.</p>

<p>"That is another of our new processes," he
added after a moment's reflection. "Echo&mdash;that's
the answer in a nutshell."</p>

<p>The captain led the way to the ship's marimeter,
a cylindrical contrivance that looked
as though it might house a compass or a
binnacle lamp.</p>

<p>"The marimeter works on the principle of
electricity controlled by sound vibration," the
captain expounded in his competent fashion.
"A sound wave is sent out from the bottom
of the vessel by mechanical means and the
instant this sound is started it is picked up
electrically and relayed to the recording instrument
and the dial of the latter begins to register.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The sound wave travels to the bottom
of the ocean and returns in the form of an
echo, and this echo is also picked up by the
diaphragm in the bottom of the boat and is
also relayed by electricity to the recording
instrument, causing the pointer to stop immediately.
Sound travels at practically a
uniform rate in the water, at about 4000
feet a second. The depth is measured by
accurately taking and recording mechanically
the time for sound to travel down and back.
The depth is shown on the dial in fathoms,
and four soundings may be made per minute."</p>

<p>It all sounded so simple, and yet what a
wonderful contrivance as against the old-fashioned
method of taking deep-sea soundings.
To demonstrate Captain Austin took
an electrical sounding for his new protegées
and in a few seconds the "echo" had returned
from the bottom of the Sound, showing a
depth of ten fathoms.</p>

<p>For some hours, under the guidance of the
ship's skipper, the trio of newcomers thoroughly
inspected the <i>Nemo</i>. This plainly
was the "prospecting" boat of the salvage
company's fleet. It went out and staked the
claim and then called on the full facilities of
the fleet for completion of the job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Austin, completely won by the
honesty and candor of his new friends, and
acting under instructions of superintendent
Brown, took the boys entirely into his confidence.</p>

<p>"I do not mind telling you that we are after
high stakes this trip," he told them. "An
English steamship, the <i>Dominion</i>, was sunk
off Martha's Vineyard late in 1916. She had
among her cargo a quantity of gold bullion
and South African diamonds. She took fire
after being shelled by a German submarine
and was making a run for the coast when she
went down. She is between two and three
hundred feet down and it is our job to look
her over for the next few days and report
back to Bridgeford on our findings."</p>

<p>The news of impending action was joyously
received by Jay and Dick, who declared they
were ready on a moment's notice to take their
first dip into the blue for their new employers.
What! thirty dollars a day, and the chance to
win a percentage on any treasure actually
reclaimed! It was a wonderful opportunity,
to their minds.</p>

<p>"Better take a look over your diving equipment
and see that everything is all right,"
suggested the ship's captain. Jay and Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
accordingly went thoroughly over their outfits
during the next few hours, finding suits,
shoes, helmets and air-line connections quite
up to the standard of the latest improved
diving equipment.</p>

<p>It was a lively crew that spent the warm
spring evening above decks on the <i>Nemo</i> as
she worked her way steadily on her course
toward Martha's Vineyard, off the New England
coast. By morning they would have
arrived at their destination&mdash;ready for the
adventure!</p>

<p>A sense of eager expectancy pervaded the
snug little "sub." Although Captain Austin
had not shared his confidences broadcast as he
had with his new divers the men seemed to
divine that they were out for real business this
time. They were for the most part singing
merrily and glad to be in on the big game of
treasure hunting.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning we'll be back at the
old stunt again," mused Dick. "Rocked in
the cradle of the deep."</p>

<p>"Hope we get the first peep at the poor
old <i>Dominion</i>," said Jay. Although this was
a dangerous calling the two navy veterans
had come to look upon it by now as any
other ordinary duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only thing I don't like about this outfit is
that fellow Weddigen," reflected Jay.</p>

<p>"You mean the fellow you punched on the
jaw?" Jay nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, just let him start something and
we'll show him where he's at," snapped Larry
Seymour, who had just strolled up.</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon we can take care of that gent
if he is inclined to get frisky," remarked Dick
meaningly, convinced in his own mind that
Weddigen was some kind of a tough customer
who was playing his own little game in this
adventure.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER V
<span class="ch">A Submarine Pickpocket</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">"GOOD morning, Mr. Thacker; I hope
you feel like taking a walk on the
bottom of the sea this morning."</p>

<p>The smiling face of Captain Austin greeted
Jay as the latter climbed up through the forward
hatch of the <i>Nemo</i> for a breath of the
clear fresh morning air. The <i>Nemo</i> had
arrived during the night at her destination and
rode gracefully at anchor on an easy swell.</p>

<p>"Never felt better in my life," answered the
Brighton boy. The two lads had enjoyed a
fine night's rest even in the cramped quarters
of a submarine. Pretty soon Dick came
climbing on deck, throwing out his chest for
an inhalation of the clear balmy ozone.</p>

<p>The <i>Nemo</i> was riding slightly offshore.
Because of her light draft she had been
enabled to go very close. The pounding of
the surf could be plainly heard.</p>

<p>"You see those ships' ribs sticking out of
the water directly alongside?" asked the captain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
pointing off the starboard quarter of the
<i>Nemo</i>.</p>

<p>Both boys followed the line of direction.
A glass was not necessary, for there, not more
than thirty or forty yards away, loomed the
three gaunt curved ribs of a ship, clearly outlined
against the white of the breaking rollers
beyond.</p>

<p>"That's what's left of the <i>Dominion</i>,"
explained the captain. "Not many people
know she's here; we're quite a bit out of the
regular shipping lines; but that's her all
right."</p>

<p>Jay was thrilled at the spectacle. Right
there under the water reposed valuable treasure,
and he the one who was to dip down deep
to clutch it from the depths!</p>

<p>"Expect that ship is pretty well battered
to pieces, but have every reason to believe
the real booty is still intact," Captain Austin
was saying, as several deckmen began dragging
various diving paraphernalia on deck.</p>

<p>The chief executive turned to Jay.</p>

<p>"I want you to go down this morning, if
you are feeling fit and fine, Mr. Thacker."</p>

<p>Jay indicated he was quite ready and never
felt better in his life.</p>

<p>"This chap Weddigen is also going down,"
continued Austin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Jay held his tongue, having learned well the
lesson of discipline in the navy. Although
he distrusted the fellow and knew he nursed
a personal grudge, Jay was determined to
make the best of the situation.</p>

<p>Dick was to remain on board the <i>Nemo</i> and
supervise Jay's air and signal lines. Knowing
quite well by his long experience that it was
foolhardy for a diver to eat but a very little
before descending into the pressure of the
depths, Jay drank only a glassful of orange
juice and a cup of black unsweetened coffee.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock final preparations for the
descent were under way. Jay was going off
the forward deck of the <i>Nemo</i>, and Weddigen
was to take off from aft the conning tower.
The huge unwieldy diving suit, the clodhopper
shoes of iron, the ghoulish looking headgear
with its grotesque looking eyes were ready to
be donned. The <i>Nemo</i> was anchored to the
lee shore of the island; the water was comparatively
quiet and there seemed little danger
of the "life lines" becoming unmanageable.</p>

<p>"Gee, wish I was going along," sighed Dick
a bit wistfully.</p>

<p>Jay grinned. "Never mind, old pal; you'll
get your turn all right before this is over. I'll
stay my limit, probably not find anything, and
then they will send you down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Austin called Jay and Weddigen
together amidships to give them their last
instructions. With a stub of a pencil he drew
a plan of the wreck as near as he could estimate
it from the previous reports of other
divers and the ship's owners.</p>

<p>"The ribs sticking out of the water yonder
are supposed to be forward of the room where
the treasure was stored," he told them. "It
is reported that the diamonds are in a small
iron safe that was kept in the captain's cabin.
The bullion was in iron chests also in the
captain's cabin."</p>

<p>He indicated on the rough map where the
strong boxes were supposed to lie.</p>

<p>"When the <i>Dominion</i> ran for the shore,"
he continued, "she was afire aft and amidships.
She struck the sand so hard she buried her
nose in the soft ground, and those ribs you
see were planted so solidly that the surf was
never able to beat them down. You ought
to find the captain's cabin about twenty paces
aft of the ribs."</p>

<p>Jay examined the crude sketch long and
hard, asking many questions to make as sure
of his ground as possible. Weddigen scowled
and guessed how he would "jes prowl around
until he found it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go ahead then, boys, and get in your
togs," ordered the captain.</p>

<p>With Dick's assistance Jay was soon ready
to go over. The suit securely fastened on to
make sure there were no leakages anywhere
that would let in water, he sprawled on a
deck chair while Dick put on the ponderous
twenty-pound shoes that were to help anchor
him down. Soon the helmet was adjusted on
to the breastplate and the thumb screws set.
The eye-pieces were hinged like a ship's porthole
windows and not closed until the very
last minute.</p>

<p>As Jay was ready for the finishing touches
Dick leaned close and peered into the face of
his old chum.</p>

<p>"All right, old boy," he comforted. "I'll
be right here on this end keeping close watch.
If anything happens just give me the emergency
quick. And, for the love of Mike, keep
your googley-eyes on that bird Weddigen."</p>

<p>Jay smiled, an answering "Yes," and motioned
for the eye-pieces to be closed. Immediately
the air pump was started, feeding
its supply of fresh oxygen to the imprisoned
diver. With a man on each side of him Jay
scuffed across deck and went over the side on
a ladder leading down into the water. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
before his helmeted head went under he took
one last look around for direction and fixed in
his mind the path to be taken in the journey
toward the <i>Dominion</i>.</p>

<p>Down he went. The sun shone into the
water, and with the sand for a background
the light in the sea was fairly good.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are&mdash;and now for the
<i>Dominion</i>," Jay chuckled to himself as his
feet hit bottom and he started along, using a
small peak-nosed shovel as a push-pole to help
himself along.</p>

<p>Through his bull's-eyes he could see ahead
some distance. Vainly he cast right and left
for some trace of Weddigen, but nowhere was
his diving companion to be seen.</p>

<p>"I'll just be careful not to run afoul of that
big boy's lines down here," Jay told himself.
It was not so easy to defend against an attack
of any kind under water clad in heavy diving
habiliments.</p>

<p>Groping his way forward steadily inch by
inch, Jay figured soon he must be in the
neighborhood of those ships' ribs. The
breathing was good and the air lines were
working fine under the expert direction of his
chum. These two had teamed together before;
always when one of them was down the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
looked after the equipment above deck, keeping
a sharp eye on the air pump to see there
was no let-up in its functioning.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Jay saw something looming up
directly ahead. For the moment it assumed
fantastic shape and the youth was unable to
determine whether it was just some sort of
an apparition or some tangible substance.
But only for a moment.</p>

<p>In another instant the specter of the
wrecked ship filtered through the greenish haze
of the water into the eyes of the groping diver;
a weird spectacle that danced and eddied to
the tilt of the waters like the wavering film
of a cinematograph.</p>

<p>"By George! there she is," gasped Jay to
himself in sheer delight. In spite of his
accustomed self-complacency and cool nerve
the youth found his pulses fluttering wildly.</p>

<p>"And now to get busy," he murmured to
himself, picking his way laboriously over
a sand hummock. The sea muck was
so loose that the young diver's ponderous
shoes settled deep into it at each stride. But
the water was clear and the precious oxygen
was coming to him in steady relays from the
<i>Nemo's</i> pump.</p>

<p>"What could have become of that chap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Weddigen?" speculated Jay as he strained
through the windows of his eyes for some trace
of the other diver. Not a hint of him in any
direction.</p>

<p>At last the youth came to the side of the
wreck. His sense of direction and implicit
obedience to instructions had carried him
right. He had arrived directly where the
nose of the <i>Dominion</i> had imbedded itself in
the sand.</p>

<p>"Good enough," he thought, as he gazed
upward to where the torn timbers lifted themselves
toward the surface of the sea. One
glance indicated that the <i>Dominion</i> lay listed
slightly to port in such a slanting position
that her bow was elevated at something like
an angle of thirty degrees.</p>

<p>Groping his way along the side of the old
freighter the persevering young diver found
to his great delight that the tides and deep
water currents had banked in sand all along
the side of the <i>Dominion</i>. Like a pillow ridge
this sand supported the weight of the lost
cargo-carrier.</p>

<p>"This makes it all the easier; I can walk
right aboard without any formalities," laughed
Dick as he dropped to his hands and knees.
He figured it would be easier going "doggey"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
fashion than to attempt to walk up the side
of the incline and run the risk of sinking deep
into the fluid underfooting.</p>

<p>Cautiously he made his way forward. And
now the giant proportions of the ship's superstructure
were outlined against the green
background. The three wide smokestacks
loomed ominously in front of him pitched at
an angle where they seemed tottering to their
fall. The main mast forward with its crow's-nest
still intact was poked out like a weird
totem pole bereft of all rigging by reason of
the lashing given it by the submarine currents.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Jay worked himself up
close to the wounded hulk. He could see he
had come alongside directly abaft the forward
funnel.</p>

<p>"Things seem to be breaking right, for I
am right off the particular spot where I want
to go aboard," soliloquized the youth as he
paused to adjust his air lines.</p>

<p>A port hole eyed him directly in front. Jay
was minded to step into the enclosure and
thus raise himself into a position where he
could grasp the twisted deck rail and pull
himself aboard. He endeavored to thrust his
right leg into the opening but found the distance
too great for the weight of his iron shoe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
with the pressure of water against it. Just
at that moment his attention was attracted
by two oblique lines drawn sharply across his
line of vision against the background of the
ship's funnels.</p>

<p>"What in the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then it dawned on him. Weddigen was
already aboard. The lines were his air and
signal lines.</p>

<p>"Beat me to it, I guess," was his mental
comment. This made him only the more
determined to get into that cabin at all
hazards.</p>

<p>Signaling that he desired to be raised a bit
in the water Jay waited until he had been
hauled up four or five feet. As his body came
abreast of the ship's rail he grasped it firmly
with one hand and signalled sharply with the
other to stop. It was easy work to clamber
over the rail.</p>

<p>And now for the captain's cabin! Groping
his way forward along the deck from state
room to state room, maintaining his footing
on the sloping incline by grasping the battered
woodwork, he came at last to a companionway
leading below. It was just aft the pilot house,
and this, he surmised, was the way to what
had once been the quarters of the <i>Dominion's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
skipper. It was necessary to go slowly and
surely, for well this young diver knew the
danger of entangled air lines.</p>

<p>As he drew a powerful submarine flashlight
from his belt and touched its illumination
spring the life lines of his fellow diver brushed
his helmet.</p>

<p>"Weddigen got the jump on me, sure
enough," he thought.</p>

<p>Floundering along as carefully as he knew
how, the Brighton boy let himself down the
companionway on the rickety stairs. It was
ticklish business. At any moment the air
lines might be fouled by the swaying currents
and the diver have to fight for his life or
perish of suffocation.</p>

<p>"But if that big bully Weddigen can do it,
I can do it," he assured himself.</p>

<p>By now he was conscious of a faint glow
of light in the subaqueous chamber more
remote than the pencil rays of his own flash.
This, he figured, was the light of Weddigen.
A slight turn to the left and he stepped into
the erstwhile domain of the <i>Dominion's</i> chief
executive.</p>

<p>Through the blur of water a startling picture
was unfolded before his eyes. Crouched
over a square iron chest, playing the rays of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
his flashlight over an iron strong box, was
the figure of a diver. The cover of the chest
had been pried off. The diver was transferring
the contents of the chest into a long narrow
slit of a pocket that bulged from the side of
his diving armor!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER VI
<span class="ch">Jay Fights for His Life</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">"WEDDIGEN helping himself to the
diamonds!"</p>

<p>Could it be possible that this
fellow was a submarine pickpocket who was
playing his own little game? Was he a pirate
of the deep who pretended to be working for
others and all the time seeking covertly to
appropriate reclaimed treasure solely for himself?
Certainly it appeared so to Jay Thacker
as he stood watching the dramatic scene.</p>

<p>The diver determined to see it through without
making the other acquainted with the
fact that he was being watched. Very quickly
Weddigen was working, seemingly on the
theory that Jay might arrive on the scene
any moment, and that he must lose no time.</p>

<p>Jay noted that Weddigen was slipping something
like tiny pebbles into the tiny pocket of
his diving suit, letting them in very slowly
and patting them down to make sure the currents
would not wash them out.</p>

<p>"Diamonds!" gasped Jay, remembering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
instantly that part of the treasure to be
reclaimed from the <i>Dominion</i> was to be
diamonds.</p>

<p>The Brighton youth determined to see it
through. Crouching back against the side of
the areaway he brushed the eyes of his helmet
the better to see. Now Weddigen was buttoning
over a flap on the pocket!</p>

<p>Between flashes of light Jay could see that
the man was working now on the chest.
First he battered shut the lid again as best he
could. Next he took a coil of chain from his
belt and lashed it around the strong box.
Then he picked up a long slim crowbar that
he had brought along as a push-pole and
began to work the chest across the floor of the
compartment. He could only move it a few
inches at a time because of its weight and
the pressure of the water. Slowly but surely,
though, he pushed the thing along in front of
him.</p>

<p>"He's coming right toward me with it and
I might as well make known my presence,"
reasoned Jay.</p>

<p>He was on the point of flashing on his own
light when Weddigen stopped, tossed the
crowbar aside and knelt again over the
treasure box. For a time he fumbled in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
dark while Jay stood wondering what was
going on. Again a flash of light, and in that
instant the Brighton youth saw that the other
diver was making fast on his salvage lines.
Beyond a doubt his plan was to send the
treasure chest aloft now that he had worked
it close to the door of the areaway where it
might be yanked up the companionway and
thence up through the depths to the deck of
the <i>Nemo</i>.</p>

<p>"Going to send the rest of the diamonds up
and try to get away with what he has already
helped himself to," thought Jay as the daring
scheme of his fellow diver was now revealed.
But Jay had seen all and was determined so
soon as he got back on the <i>Nemo</i> to compel
an opening of that cunning little pocket on
the side of Weddigen's diving suit.</p>

<p>But now a real danger confronted the
Brighton youth. Suppose Weddigen gave the
signal for the diamond chest to be raised away?
Deckmen aboard the <i>Nemo</i>, when the signal
was given, would haul away with all their
vigor, eager to perform their part in the salvage
of the much desired treasure.</p>

<p>Crouched in the areaway outside the cabin
Jay would be directly in the line of the treasure
chest as it was yanked away. Suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
iron box came his way? Perhaps it might
crash full into his life lines? One swift blow
might sever his air hose and leave him helpless
against the inrushing water? Or suppose
it cut off his signal lines, leaving him powerless
to ask for a lift off the ocean bed?</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do, and that
was to get out of there as quickly as possible.
Weddigen would not signal for the strong
box to be hoisted away until he, too, was out
of harm's way; and Jay, now that he had been
an eye-witness to the theft, was determined
not to let the other know he had seen the theft
until they were back on the <i>Nemo</i> again.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible he shuffled along
the areaway and began climbing the steps
toward the deck of the <i>Dominion</i>. He was
just in time, too, for a glimmer of light behind
him indicated that Weddigen was following
close behind. Rather than reveal his presence
Jay fumbled along in the darkness, climbing
the steps without resorting to the use of his
flash.</p>

<p>Once on deck he turned sharply aft and
moved away from the companionway leading
below. In his anxiety to make haste he
momentarily let go the state room door by
which he had steadied himself and in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
instant his feet flew from under him. The
slimy deck would have been hard enough
walking had the <i>Dominion</i> lay on an even
keel; but with the pitch to port the half-rotted
flooring was difficult walking for the
most experienced and careful diver.</p>

<p>As he felt himself going the unfortunate
youth grabbed for his life lines for the purpose
of signaling the "emergency"; but in the
swirl of water he was pitched headlong, the
added weight of his own diving accoutrements
bearing him along like a leaf in a windstorm.
Clear across the wide slanting deck of the
<i>Dominion</i> he was hurled until he brought up
hard against the rotted deck rail.</p>

<p>Like a drowning man grasping for a straw
Jay reached out to clutch the iron post outlined
directly in front of him; but as he
grabbed its top knob he felt the whole structure
rend and twist, its fastenings loosened by
the rust of a prolonged submergence. The
impact of the young diver's body wrenched it
loose and in a moment Jay was hurtled overboard
from the inclined deck of the <i>Dominion</i>
and enmeshed in a tangle of the collapsed deck
railing.</p>

<p>It had all happened so quickly the dazed
youth was unable to figure out where he was
and what really had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a pretty pickle I'm in," was all he
could gasp, as he sought to tear himself free
from his incumbrances.</p>

<p>And then, to his utter consternation, he found
that his air and signal lines had become all
entangled in the demolished railing! Sprawling
on his back in the soft sand that undulated
in a wavy crest against the side of the <i>Dominion</i>
he struggled in vain to tear himself free
and get to his feet. But, weighed down by
his equipment, tired out by his long stay
under water and imprisoned in the débris of
the <i>Dominion</i>, he found his strength fast
slipping.</p>

<p>"I've got to get hold of that emergency
line," he said to himself, gritting his teeth and
thrashing the water above his head for a hold
on the precious life line. Eventually he found
it and tugged with all his might, awaiting the
welcome pull that would lift him out of the
depths.</p>

<p>But no welcome pull came. The life lines
were caught in the débris! And now he found
himself breathing with difficulty. The air
lines, too, had been fouled! The air supply
was virtually cut off altogether, and the
young diver breathing only the air contained
within his diving armor!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looks as though I was up against it unless
I can work these lines free," the thought
flashed through his brain with unrelenting
reality. Now, indeed, was he fighting for life
against the very fates!</p>

<p>With the desperation born of madness Jay
battled to free himself. Caught like a fly
in a great spider's web, he knew every moment
was precious. Unless those air lines were
freed or he got a signal to the surface he was
doomed.</p>

<p>Seizing the life lines above his helmet he
drew them tight in his hands and followed
them along until he came to the first entanglement
of iron piping. For a moment the
impediment thwarted him, and then he tore
it free of the hose lines. But still no relief.</p>

<p>By now his brain was reeling and he could
feel the blood vessels standing out on his
forehead. A sense of suffocation pressed his
heart and lungs and he found his breath coming
in short wheezy gasps.</p>

<p>"Can it be that I'm lost!" he cried half
aloud, the sound of his voice flooding his own
ears like the wail of a siren.</p>

<p>But this was a time for self-control if he
was to escape at all the perilous plight into
which he had fallen. By sheer force of will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he calmed himself and set about again to free
himself. Taking the air lines as before he
followed them to another point of contact
with the débris and slipped down to his
knees as he tugged at another joint of the
tubing.</p>

<p>Fate, however, was hard and cruel. Try
as he did, battling with all his strength and
praying fervently as he worked, he was unable
to move the obstacle. His fingers felt numb
and weak; they refused to respond to his will.
Even his legs seemed paralyzed. And again
that horrible clutching at the throat and lungs!</p>

<p>"I&mdash;&mdash;guess&mdash;&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;can't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice trailed off into a whisper and his
brain swam until a panorama of mythical
scenes and figures flitted before his fancy.
Still clutching the lines of hose that refused
him life he reeled and stretched himself helplessly
on the floor of the ocean. Dreamily he
thought of home, of Brighton, of the service he
had lately left. Now he was with the fleet
vainly tugging to fasten an obdurate mine in
place with other jackies of Uncle Sam's mighty
war fleet.</p>

<p>"Now we've got the haughty Germans,"
he screamed in his delirium. All the while he
was gasping and gurgling as his shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
heaved and his lungs were convulsed in the
agony of suffocation. Life was slipping fast
away, and life was sweet to this youth who
had dared death for his country and come
through unscathed in the two years' campaign
in the North Sea. By the irony of fate he
had lived through all the period of the war
only to come home to an untimely death like
this while searching for lost treasure!</p>

<p>Now he was floating free in the ocean, a
great filmy light suffusing the whole of the
green sea, a myriad of soft-clad figures dancing
before his glazed eyes, the murmur of some
cathedral orchestra intermingled with the
song of the sea. Out, out, out through the
vast unknown recesses of the sea he drifted,
propelled along by some unseen force....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Something wrong down there!" Dick
Monaghan, standing guard over the life lines
of his chum aboard the <i>Nemo</i>, sensed the
danger of his old Brighton pal. No signal of
any kind had come up to him from the depths,
and yet he seemed to realize, for some strange
reason, that a mishap of some kind had befallen
Jay.</p>

<p>"What's that?" called out Captain Austin
as he hurried forward to where Dick held the
lines over the side of the <i>Nemo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had a hunch of some kind that Jay was
in trouble," explained Dick. "I've been
trying for the last two or three minutes to
get some kind of an answering signal from
below, but I can't seem to get him. And
there's been such a tugging on the lift lines
at times. I don't quite understand it."</p>

<p>"Pump working all right?" asked the
captain.</p>

<p>"So far as we can tell, although it seems to
have slowed up somewhat," Dick replied,
somewhat agitated.</p>

<p>Just then a shout arose from aft the <i>Nemo</i>.
The deckmen were hauling something over
the side and yelling their heads off with
delight.</p>

<p>"Look, a great iron treasure chest," they
chorused, as the attention of Captain Austin
and Dick was diverted for a moment from
the possible plight of Jay Thacker.</p>

<p>True enough, for as they exulted, the iron
box containing diamonds that Weddigen had
reclaimed from the captain's cabin of the
<i>Dominion</i> came over the side, dripping with
sediment and seaweed, but firmly held in an
encircling chain band.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! we have landed some
of the lost cargo." The crew were rejoicing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
over the big find of the morning, hardly able
to contain themselves over the knowledge that
a handsome chest of "swag" had been ferreted
from its submarine hiding place, and that they
would get a fine fat bonus out of the big
"divvy."</p>

<p>"Weddigen on his way up," called out the
officer in charge of the operations aft.</p>

<p>Only for a moment were Captain Austin
and Dick Monaghan deterred from the subject
that engrossed their minds. What had
become of Jay Thacker?</p>

<p>"Haul him up as fast as you can," the
captain commanded.</p>

<p>Jumping to their work, the forward crew
began tugging away at the steel cables with
which Jay had been suspended. But pull as
hard as they could they could not budge the
lost diver.</p>

<p>"Quick, men, uncover that deck winch,"
he ordered, now thoroughly alarmed.</p>

<p>In short order it was made ready for service
and the steel cables supporting Jay affixed.
A word of command from Captain Austin and
the power was turned on. For an instant the
cables wound faithfully, and then brought up
taut. Something had to give; either the
cables had to part, or the contained weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
at the sea bottom torn free of its holdings.
More power was turned on. A violent tug,
and then the winch began winding steadily
again!</p>

<p>"Thank God! it's Jay," murmured Dick a
minute or so later as the helmeted figure
appeared through the haze of the sea green.
But the arms and lower limbs hung limp, and
portions of the <i>Dominion's</i> deck rail still clung
to the suspension cables.</p>

<p>"Hurry, men, there; haul him on deck
and pull that armor off," Austin directed.</p>

<p>As the form of Jay was drawn on deck
Dick and several assistants tried to stand him
on his feet, only to see him crumple and fall
like a man of straw. One glance through
the eye ports showed closed lids. A twist of
the thumb screw and then the helmet was
raised.</p>

<p>"Jay! Jay! Speak to me," implored Dick,
bending over his chum.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER VII
<span class="ch">Diamonds are Trump</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">LIGHT! The glorious sunlight of the
world! Voices, too; the friendly voices
of his old chums aboard the <i>Nemo</i>.
These were the evidences of returned life to
Jay Thacker as he lay on the deck of the
<i>Nemo</i> looking up into the sky. It was like
a dream and his befagged brain could scarce
comprehend the situation.</p>

<p>"Jay, old boy, look at me. Do you know
me? Speak to me, pal, and tell me you are
all right again."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Dick. He was bending
over chafing the wrists of his comrade in school
and in arms. Tears were coursing down his
cheeks. But now he was happy because Jay
had opened his eyes again and smiled feebly
through flickering eyelids.</p>

<p>For some time the rescued diver lay in a
stupor. The heavy diving armor and shoes
had been wrenched off. Several members of
crew were rubbing his wrists and ankles,
An oxygen tank had been used with successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
results. The tiny spark of life remaining had
been fanned again after a grim battle between
science and nature. And science had turned
the ally of nature.</p>

<p>"Do you know me now?" faltered Dick.</p>

<p>For answer Jay opened his eyes again, and
this time he recognized his chum.</p>

<p>"Where have I been? What happened to
me?" he began.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember? You were down
there working on the <i>Dominion</i>. You got all
tangled up in something and we just pulled
you up in the nick of time."</p>

<p>And then it all came back to Jay; the terrible
struggle for life on the bottom of the
sea. Those twisted air lines! He seemed to
be living it all over again. And that mass of
débris that held him fast!</p>

<p>"Pull it off of me, Dick; cut me free," he
moaned feebly.</p>

<p>"You are all right again, old boy; you're
right here on the deck of the <i>Nemo</i>," reassured
Dick in soothing tones.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the iron constitution of
the Brighton boy responded to resuscitation
measures. Good fresh air flowed again into
his lungs, clearing his brain and setting his
circulation going anew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is Weddigen?" asked Jay, with a
startled expression.</p>

<p>"He's here on the aft deck, pretty well
tuckered out, but fine and dandy, nevertheless,"
Dick told him.</p>

<p>"And the diamonds&mdash;did he send them up?"
inquired Jay.</p>

<p>"You bet your boots he did; all here safe
and sound," was his chum's rejoinder. "A
nice day's work, too; but what would we have
cared for the stones if your life had been forfeit
in the deal."</p>

<p>The diamonds! How did Jay know about
them?</p>

<p>"How did you know Weddigen landed any
diamonds?" asked Dick, bending over his
chum.</p>

<p>"I saw them," came the answer.</p>

<p>"But Weddigen says he landed them all
alone and didn't see a trace of you all the time
he was down. How's that?" Dick was nonplussed.</p>

<p>"Tell you after a bit," whispered Jay.</p>

<p>They made him as comfortable as possible
on deck, preferring to leave him out in the
fresh air and sunshine rather than carry him
below. Dick took complete charge of him,
and a capable physician he proved as he ministered
to the needs of his chum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that Jay had been rescued, the men
of the <i>Nemo</i> were celebrating hilariously the
salvage of the precious jewels, knowing the
contents of the chest must be worth many
thousands of dollars. Under the direction of
Captain Austin the strong box was carried
below, not to be opened until the <i>Nemo</i>
returned to her base at Bridgeford.</p>

<p>Weddigen still reclined on deck. It had
been a long, hard fight under water and he,
too, had somewhat overstayed his time limit.</p>

<p>His friends in the crew were fêting him.
They crowded about, patting him on the back
and congratulating him for his plucky and
successful efforts to get at the lost treasure.</p>

<p>"Wait till we get back to Bridgeford&mdash;the
swellest time you ever had in your life,"
shouted one enthusiast.</p>

<p>All of this adulation pleased Weddigen.
The rôle of the hero appealed to him and he
was enjoying the situation immensely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jay was slowly but surely
returning to life. The oxygen tank had performed
yeoman service. Color was coming
back into the face and circulation had been
restored. A stimulant was offered, but the
stout-hearted lad declined it, smilingly preferring
to keep the temperance pledge that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he had taken before he had left home to go to
school.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Cap, but I'm coming back in fine
shape," he mumbled, while Dick fairly beamed
over the recovery of his chum.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Jay was able to sit up.
He drank eagerly the cup of hot black coffee
that was offered him. He was very weak
from his trying ordeal, and no one ventured
to ask him about his hazardous trip to the
<i>Dominion</i> and his narrow escape from death.</p>

<p>By and by Jay motioned Dick to come
closer.</p>

<p>"Did Weddigen land any treasure?" he
asked with an inquisitive look.</p>

<p>Dick launched into the story, telling how
the strong box had been hauled over the side
amid wild jubilation and taken below into
Captain Austin's quarters.</p>

<p>"Are you sure there were diamonds in the
chest?" persisted Jay.</p>

<p>"Sure, Mike," responded his chum. "Oodles
of them worth thousands of dollars.
Glittering cut stones; a young fortune big
enough to put us all on easy street for the
rest of our lives if they belonged to us."</p>

<p>Jay pondered the situation for a moment.
In his eyes was a queer look that neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Dick nor Larry Seymour, who had joined the
group, could fathom.</p>

<p>"Is Weddigen still on deck?" persisted Jay.</p>

<p>"Still back there resting up while the crew
make a fuss over him," replied Larry.</p>

<p>"All right, now, Larry, do what I tell you,
please," said Jay. "Just stroll back there
casually and look him over without arousing
suspicion. See if you don't notice a narrow
slit of a pocket on the inside of the right leg
of his armor suit, buttoned over with a flap.
When he gets up to take off his diving suit
just manage to accidentally flip that pocket
open and then keep your eyes on it."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" offered Larry,
perplexed by the directions given him by Jay.</p>

<p>"Remember, I never fooled you in my life,
old friend," answered the latter. "Just do
what I tell you, and perhaps you'll have a
bit of a surprise party."</p>

<p>Jay was weakened by the exertion of talking
and sank back to rest again with closed
eyes. Withdrawing a few paces, Dick and
Larry discussed the suggestions made by Jay.</p>

<p>"Think he is still a little dippy as a result
of his experience?" questioned Larry.</p>

<p>"Sounds rather queer, doesn't it?" pondered
Dick, unable to grasp the significance of Jay's
remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>They agreed, however, there surely must
be some ground for Jay talking so; and, moreover,
they shared similar opinions regarding
one Carl Weddigen, notwithstanding the fact
that Weddigen had made a game fight for
the diamonds and come off victorious.</p>

<p>"You stay here with Jay and I'll just stroll
aft and look the old bird over," counseled
Larry after a little further deliberation. "To
my mind he's just the kind of a fellow who
might put something over on us."</p>

<p>Dick agreed, and Larry accordingly hurried
away, slowing down to a leisurely gait after
he had passed the conning tower and approached
the group of which the much-admired
diver was the central figure. As
he drew near, Larry could hear Weddigen
recounting his experiences on the ocean bed
in the hold of the <i>Dominion</i>. And he was
omitting no detail in the narration.</p>

<p>All smiles and apparently with all friendly
intent Larry eased himself into the circle of
admiring friends.</p>

<p>"How's Thacker?" queried Weddigen solicitously,
breaking away from his story of the
reclamation.</p>

<p>"Coming along fine," said Larry, detailing
how Jay had responded satisfactorily to treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Glad of that," responded Weddigen. "I'm
sorry we couldn't both have come upon the
glittering goods together and yanked them
out with a little teamwork. Tell him I'll be
over to see him in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Larry hung around while other members of
the crew insisted that Weddigen complete his
story of the salvage expedition. But Carl was
in no mood to continue the yarn and said he
guessed he was feeling strong enough now to
take off his diving clothes and go below for a
snooze. Accordingly he struggled to his feet
with the aid of several members of the crew.</p>

<p>Larry was now all attention. Following
out the instructions of Jay he carefully examined
the trousers of the big diver. Yes, there
it was; the telltale little pocket on the side
of the right leg. Larry edged up closer to
get a better look at it. There was a certain
bulge to it as though it was well filled.</p>

<p>"Gee, you're a regular Beau Brummel of a
diver with your fancy clothes," offered Seymour
facetiously as he smiled up into the face
of Weddigen.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, fellow?" blurted the
latter, turning short to survey the Bridgeford
seaman whom he remembered as one of the
three he had encountered the day he and Jay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
had come together just outside Superintendent
Brown's office.</p>

<p>"Why, with your pretty little side pockets,"
prattled Larry with a sickly grin.</p>

<p>With a flourish of the hand he indicated
the bulging patch on the side of Weddigen's
armor, and before the latter could intervene
Larry swept his hand carelessly but unerringly
over the pocket, giving it such a thrust that
the button slipped through the stout canvas
eye-hole. At the same time Weddigen
clutched the pocket as though to cover it.
But he was too late!</p>

<p>Instantly a half dozen glittering diamonds
popped from the aperture and rolled on the
deck of the <i>Nemo</i>, sparkling in the morning
sun like the jewels of a monarch's crown!</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you big stiff,"
growled Weddigen in dismay as the treasure
that he had filched from the strong box while
yet in the wreck of the <i>Dominion</i> was revealed.</p>

<p>"What do I mean? I mean that you're a
rascal and a thief," shot back Larry, fully
convinced now that the sparklers were part
of the loot that had been recovered from the
lost British liner.</p>

<p>Immediately there was a great hubbub
among the crew as they pounced upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
scattered diamonds, eager to retrieve them
before they rolled overboard or were jostled
below by the roll of the <i>Nemo</i>.</p>

<p>"You're a big fool and I'll break your face
so soon as I get in trim again, that's what
I'll do," snorted Weddigen in a rage.</p>

<p>But Larry was his equal in the showdown.</p>

<p>"You may have a little trouble smashing
my face," he countered, "but you are going
to have a bigger time explaining to Captain
Austin and the Bridgeford Salvage Company
how you came in possession of those diamonds."</p>

<p>Attracted by the commotion, Captain Austin
came hurrying up.</p>

<p>"What's all the commotion about?" he demanded.
There had been excitement enough
on the <i>Nemo</i> for one morning.</p>

<p>"It's none of your business, and I'll prove
mightily easy how I came about those diamonds,"
Weddigen was saying as the ship's
executive officer drew near.</p>

<p>"This man is not playing fair," denounced
Larry, pointing out the diver to Captain
Austin. "He's holding back a whole pocketful
of diamonds on you, Captain."</p>

<p>The captain was so amazed he could only
gaze from one to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are making a grave accusation, Mr.
Seymour, and against a man who has risked
his life this morning in the recovery of thousands
of dollars' worth of diamonds," the ship
captain remarked slowly. There were murmurs
of approval from members of the crew.</p>

<p>"All right, sir, I only ask that Mr. Weddigen
bare the contents of that pocket on the right
leg of his diving suit," retorted Larry.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned forthwith on the diver.
But the crafty Weddigen was equal to the
occasion.</p>

<p>"I was trying to tell this big boob I could
explain everything," he countered with an
air of superiority. "You see, it was this way,
Captain. When I came upon that treasure
chest down there I had to bang it about a bit
to get it ready for the lift. You can see for
yourself if you inspect it closely that the
hinges were rusted. In prodding about I
loosened up the lid. I thought I'd just take
a peep to see if I really had the goods. There
they were, all right. Some of them were
lying loose, so I just scooped them up and
slipped them into this vent in my suit. I
didn't want to take any chances on losing
them."</p>

<p>As he talked he stooped over and holding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
cupped hand over the pocket forced out a
handful of the finest of diamonds, ranging in
size from one- to three- and five-carat stones.</p>

<p>"There you are; I never had the slightest
intention of keeping them," blustered Weddigen.
"This fresh guy Seymour thinks he
gets me in wrong, and I'll attend to him later.
I was waiting until I got rested up a bit before
coming to you with them."</p>

<p>Upon Larry he cast a murderous scowl of
hatred as Captain Austin hurried the diamonds
below, apparently satisfied with Weddigen's
story.</p>

<p>But Larry, hearing the true story later from
the lips of Jay Thacker, knew Weddigen's
quick-witted defense was but skilled camouflage
to cover his attempted theft of the
pocketed diamonds. With the two Brighton
youths, he formed a pact to keep a watchful
eye on the surly diver in the future.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER VIII
<span class="ch">Uncle Sam Calls</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SOME fellows are pursued by luck no
matter where they turn in life. Others
of evil design seem to be able to get
away with anything they attempt solely on
their nerve. Carl Weddigen was one of this
class. Not one chap in a thousand, caught
as he had been with stolen diamonds, would
have breasted it out and escaped so cleverly
by use of his nimble wits. Criminologists'
records show that the average thief trapped
as Weddigen was either surrenders abjectly or
makes a break for it in an effort to escape.
The crafty minority stand their ground and
worm their way out by subterfuge.</p>

<p>"I'll say he's got the nerve, all right,"
remarked Dick Monaghan. The <i>Nemo</i> had
returned to Bridgeford and the members of
the crew were enjoying a few days' rest after
their arduous and successful trip in exploration
of the sunken <i>Dominion</i>.</p>

<p>"Nerve!" retorted Larry Seymour. "Why,
if that guy had been sent into Germany by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
General Pershing he could have dragged the
Kaiser out of Berlin and made those dazed
Fritzies think he was only kidding them."</p>

<p>Jay Thacker smiled at that. He was feeling
much better after his experiences; in fact, a
couple of good nights' sleep and recreation
had put him back in good trim again. Two
years at sea in the U. S. Navy will toughen
the bone and muscle of any lad.</p>

<p>Dick and Larry had been wanting Jay to
go to Captain Austin to relate the whole story
of what had happened on the bottom of the
sea in the cabin of the <i>Dominion</i>. Magnanimously,
Jay had spurned the proposition.</p>

<p>"They might think I was jealous because
Weddigen fished up the diamonds while all I
got was a handful of deck railing that well-nigh
finished me," was his answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you owe it to yourself and to
the company," argued Dick. "Think how
that bird may clean out the bunch again."</p>

<p>Larry was shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Never on your life. Remember, I'm
always on deck when he's working below, and
you can bet your bottom dollar I'll put him
under my nice little X-ray every time he
comes up again. No, sir-ee, fellows, I'm wise
to that gink for all time. He may think he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
slippery, but he'll find I'm the original slippery
elm."</p>

<p>Deep down Jay resented this big diver's
bold audacity and cunning. Never had he
seen anything so brazen as the way Weddigen
had smoothed over the matter of the diamonds
that he had carried in his diving trousers'
pocket. Nervily he had sought out Captain
Austin and explained the whole thing several
times over. The captain had seemingly been
pretty well convinced that Weddigen was on
the square in the matter, and this had only
strengthened Jay's determination to keep
silence.</p>

<p>"But I'll get him in the long run, for he's
a crook of the deepest dye and murder is
sure to out," he had told himself.</p>

<p>For some days the two Brighton lads and
their friend Larry Seymour remained inactive
about the big shipyard at Bridgeford awaiting
the call to further service. Captain Austin
had told them to take things easy. Superintendent
Brown and the higher officials of the
company were elated at the success of the
<i>Nemo's</i> crew in bringing up some of the treasure
of the <i>Dominion</i> and had decreed that as
part of their reward they were to loaf a while.
Eventually, each lad knew, he would come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
for a slice of the huge "divvy" that was sure
to be tendered the company for salvaging the
lost diamonds. The Brighton boys were
delighted with the prospect, for it meant the
money would go a long ways toward payment
of their tuition for the new school year. They
had expected to be assigned to the job of
bringing up the gold bullion from the <i>Dominion</i>,
but more urgent work awaited them.</p>

<p>Great secrecy was attendant upon the
fitting out of a special ship in the yard that
the boys had heard was to be used in salvage
work later in the summer. With it the Bridgeford
officials contemplated using some of their
new apparatus and employing some of their
lately developed processes for deep-sea salvage.</p>

<p>The ship, which they had heard referred to
as the <i>Jules Verne</i>, was denied to everybody
except the chosen men employed in putting
the finishing touches on her. She was roped
off in a portion of the big wet basin all to
herself and armed guards kept prying eyes at
a distance.</p>

<p>"We're apt to know sooner or later," Dick
remarked as they discussed the new venture
one afternoon.</p>

<p>"And as for me, I'm getting tired of laying
around this way," said Dick. For two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they had had so much to do while serving in
the Navy that inaction now palled upon them.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait, for one morning,
a few days later, just after they had checked
in the shipyard, there came a summons to
them to appear in the office of Superintendent
Brown. They hurried over at once, finding
that official awaiting them with Captain
Austin.</p>

<p>"Morning, boys," called out the superintendent
cheerily. "I hope you are feeling in
good shape again after your tussle with the
old <i>Dominion</i>."</p>

<p>To which they answered they preferred
getting down again into the danger zone
rather than to sit around cooling their heels.</p>

<p>"That's the spirit, all right," remarked the
official with a grin. "We are proud of you
fellows who compose the crew of the <i>Nemo</i>
for what you have already done, and we sure
are going to take care of you."</p>

<p>Jay tried to explain that one man alone
had recovered the diamonds and that he was
in no sense to be credited with any of the
glory.</p>

<p>"Just the same, you were there trying hard,
and what's more you endangered your own
life in an unfortunate accident while in the
act of duty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>And then the superintendent began telling
them why he had summoned them to headquarters.</p>

<p>"You chaps doubtless know that the <i>Jules
Verne</i> will be ready for her maiden trip within
the next two weeks," he began.</p>

<p>The boys perked up at this when it seemed
likely they were to be let in on the big secret
that had every man in the yard guessing.</p>

<p>"I can only say at this time," continued Mr.
Brown, "that the <i>Jules Verne</i> combines our
latest improved method of searching the ocean
bottom and has facilities that will greatly
expedite deep-sea salvage work. You will
know in due time, for you chaps will be
among the first batch of divers sent out on
the <i>Jules Verne</i>. We shall want to thoroughly
acquaint you at first with the operation
of the new diving bell before you will
actually engage in salvage work."</p>

<p>The yard official paused to draw several
times on his cigar.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, I need you for a diving
expedition of tremendous importance to Uncle
Sam. Are you game?"</p>

<p>He looked from one face to the other, eying
the boys with a roguish smile.</p>

<p>They nodded their heads eagerly. "If it's
for Uncle Sammy, lead us to it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, listen," said Superintendent Brown,
as the boys sat wondering what was coming.
"An executive officer from the Bureau of
Naval Operations in Washington is here on a
mission of great importance. It seems the
Navy Department has been watching our
salvage work, and read about what you boys
were doing in the hold of the <i>Dominion</i>.
They want us to do a piece of work for them
that demands speed as well as secrecy."</p>

<p>And then he explained in detail. During
the war, at the time when a fleet of German
submarines had escaped the allied fleets in
the North Sea and come to this side of the
Atlantic to attack shipping, and particularly
supply ships bound for Europe, one of the
U-boats had been sunk off Cape May, N. J.,
at the mouth of the Delaware River. Submarine
chasers putting out hurriedly from the
inlet had dashed up in time to drop depth
bombs on the submerging U-boat.</p>

<p>That the U-boat, badly crippled, had been
sunk had been established beyond all doubt
by navy divers who had located it on the
bottom. The Navy Department had intended
salvaging the U-boat at once but had been
prevented by reason of the fact that the war
kept the department busy sending troopships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to Europe, guarding them en route and combating
the Hun "mosquitoes" that threatened
Atlantic ports and coastwise shipping.</p>

<p>When the Navy Department had eventually
set about the salvage of the U-boat they
had found it by this time so nearly imbedded
in the floor of the ocean that only the conning
tower remained above ground. The Navy
was now ready to dig the U-boat out, but had
decided to ask the Bridgeford Company to
co-operate with them in the venture.</p>

<p>"And now we come to the meat of the
whole thing," confided the superintendent.
"The men who are to engage in this work
must be of the most trustworthy character, for
reasons I will now explain. We have selected
you fellows to get in on this because you are
naval veterans and we know you can be
trusted to the limit."</p>

<p>The superintendent motioned the boys
closer and resumed in an undertone,</p>

<p>"Deep down in that sunken U-boat are
plans of United States fortifications, ship and
munition designs and highly valuable scientific
formulas that must be recovered at
whatever cost. They were stolen from the
archives of the department at Washington by
adroit tools of the German espionage system.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
I am not at liberty to tell you how they were
stolen, for it is one of the secrets of the department.
But we are told that those plans are
on that submerged U-boat. The Germans
were smuggling them out of the country, and
it was a lucky shot from the 'ash-cans' of our
chasers that laid that particular U-boat low."</p>

<p>"Naturally, we are elated that the Department
has come to us in such an important
matter, and it is needless for me to say that
we are more than anxious to make good, not
alone for the sake of our company, but, and
very much more to the point, for the sake of
the dear old country that we love so much."</p>

<p>"And we&mdash;" began Jay.</p>

<p>"Yes, I rather fancied you two fellows
would enjoy getting in on a project of this
kind," interrupted the superintendent. "I
don't suppose it is necessary for me formally
to ask you whether you would like to look up
this unlucky U-boat."</p>

<p>"Well, hardly." Almost in unison they
had leaped to their feet to answer in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>"Bully! You are assigned forthwith, with
our hearty good wishes, and here's hoping
you succeed in putting over another neat
piece of work for Uncle Sam just as you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
over there in the North Sea. If you fellows
had laid that mine curtain before those
U-boats escaped this Cape May job never
would have happened. But now we've got
to get those plans back. They are of immense
value to our government."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't be of much value to Germany
now!" interrupted Dick with a grin.</p>

<p>"Right!" laughed the superintendent.
"Germany doesn't look very formidable, with
her surrendered navy, and her surrendered
iron and coal fields, and her surrendered stores
of munitions. But you never can tell. Besides,
there are scientific secrets in that collection
that, even if the defeated Huns couldn't
use them, could be sold for sums that would
make you gasp if I mentioned them."</p>

<p>The boys whistled.</p>

<p>"This is the information I have from the
naval officer. You can see how urgent the
job is. That sunken U-boat is guarded night
and day by American war vessels ever on the
alert. The exact spot where she lies on the
bottom is known and guarded like the gold
in the United States Treasury vaults.</p>

<p>"And now I wish you 'bon voyage,'" concluded
the superintendent as he shook hands
with the two lads. "You will go out this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
afternoon with Captain Austin on the <i>Nemo</i>;
and, don't forget, when you come back the
<i>Jules Verne</i> will be waiting for you."</p>

<p>Elated with the prospects of a new venture
of such an important character, Jay and Dick
arose to go, telling Captain Austin they would
report immediately aboard the <i>Nemo</i> and
make ready to depart for the trip down the
coast to Cape May.</p>

<p>"Better luck to you this time, Mr. Thacker,"
called out the yard superintendent.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mr. Brown. I sincerely hope
so," the youth replied.</p>

<p>Jay turned and opened the door of the
superintendent's office. As he stepped into
the hallway he came face to face with Carl
Weddigen. For an instant the latter seemed
embarrassed, but quickly regained his composure.</p>

<p>"How are you, fellows! Is Captain Austin
in there with the superintendent?" he asked
imperiously.</p>

<p>Dick replied that he was, whereupon Weddigen
coolly declared he would wait where he
was until the captain came out.</p>

<p>The boys hurried along leaving the diver
still standing outside the superintendent's
office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Funny thing how he happened to be
standing around like that," remarked Dick
as they let themselves out of the administration
building.</p>

<p>"Funny is right," countered Jay. "Looks
as though he might have been spying around
or trying to horn in where he hadn't been
invited. I've seen enough to know what kind
of a chap he is and I'm here to say I don't
think he wanted to see Captain Austin at all.
That was only a bluff. I'll bet he was listening
in on us while 'Montey' Brown was giving
us the dope on that U-boat."</p>

<p>"So!" whistled Dick. "All right, we have
his number right now. If he is going along
to Cape May&mdash;look out!"</p>

<span class="ch">Found&mdash;One U-Boat!</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">CAPE May Light loomed in the distance
like a lone sentinel of the night.
At intervals of ten seconds its long
penciled rays shot out over the ocean as the
giant electric beacon oscillated in its rhythmic
swing around the horizon. Dimly in the distance
were reflected the lights along the boardwalk
of the seashore resort, and far off toward
the north the faint blur against the night
skyline marked the spot where Wildwood
nestled on the sands.</p>

<p>The <i>Nemo</i> rode at anchor on the smooth
summer sea. To starboard lay a trim little
United States destroyer that had stood guard
for days over the submerged U-boat. Here
and there on the surface of the sea could be
seen the outlines of a submarine chaser, a
fleet of them having come out to welcome the
newly arrived salvage ship.</p>

<p>Mid-afternoon the <i>Nemo</i> had arrived from
her home base in Long Island Sound and was
awaiting now the morning to begin operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
on the foundered German submarine. There
had remained before sundown only a brief
time for a superficial examination of the sea
bottom, but in that time Jay Thacker and
Dick Monaghan, crack divers of the Bridgeford
Company, had donned diving armor and
spent an hour under water.</p>

<p>Imagine the surprise of the navy officials
when these two youths had returned to the
deck to report they could find no trace of
the lost U-boat!</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand this at all,"
remarked Lieutenant-Commander Wilberforce,
U. S. N. He and Captain Austin were conferring
together on the U. S. S. <i>Monadnock</i>,
the destroyer.</p>

<p>"Our men declare positively that this is the
identical spot where the U-boat was located
by divers some time ago," explained the officer.
"We have not been sending divers down
these last few weeks since the department
ordered us to wait until they sent salvage
facilities. But we have stood guard here
continually and can assure you absolutely
that no foreign salvage corps has been working
here."</p>

<p>Captain Austin ventured the opinion that
the U-boat had been broken up by the shifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
waters during a recent ten-day gale that
had raged up and down the coast.</p>

<p>"No, I hardly think so," hazarded Commander
Wilberforce. "When last our divers
were down they reported the U-boat well
above sea bottom. It's a mystery to me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the German craft has been covered
up with drifted sand," suggested Captain
Austin.</p>

<p>Wilberforce thought that over for a moment.</p>

<p>"That hadn't occurred to me," he resumed
after a moment. "There may be something
to that. You see, we are just off the Delaware
River breakwater and there are all kinds
of cross-currents here."</p>

<p>For an hour or more the two officers discussed
the project and collaborated on their
plans for the morrow.</p>

<p>"I've got some pretty good divers with
me," said Captain Austin as he made ready
to return to the <i>Nemo</i> for the night. "I'll
stack them against anything in the world.
If they can't find that U-boat then nobody
can find it."</p>

<p>"Good enough, I'm sure they'll do their
best." Commander Wilberforce had thought
well of Jay and Dick, and had so expressed
himself during the afternoon as he saw the
boys in action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>With the morning sun the boys were up
and ready for the day's explorations. They
were anxious to get down to business. And
furthermore, they were anxious that one or
the other should get the first assignment of
the day. Weddigen was along, but Captain
Austin had not ordered him into diving
armor the previous afternoon, and the Brighton
boys were hopeful that the task of searching
for the U-boat was to be entrusted to
them alone.</p>

<p>Jay was first to go over the side of the
<i>Nemo</i>. The sea had looked calm and placid
as a mountain lake as he started and he
figured no difficulty in getting about over the
bottom. But, as every diver knows, the sea
is the most deceptive thing in the world.
Stand on the shore on a quiet day and look
out to sea over waters unruffled save for the
roll of the surf. Everything lovely; yet,
down deep, mighty forces heaving and tossing
like a hidden monster seeking some prey to
devour.</p>

<p>From hummock to hummock the young
diver was tumbled over the submarine sandbars.
First he would be knocked down and
then as quickly stood up once more. At
intervals he would be lifted off his feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
swirled along in the vortex of a deadly current.
Then he would be slammed down hard
again and pinned with such force against the
ocean bed that it seemed he never would get
to his feet again. Occasionally he found
himself sprawled out on hands and knees like
a creeping crustacean.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances search for the
U-boat was next to impossible. Instead of
the usual green radiance of the water Jay
found himself in a deadly saffron light, at
times almost opaque. Experience had taught
him that that meant the sand was in motion.
Light conditions, therefore, were not favorable
for exploration, since the youth could not
see very far in any direction. Peer about as
he did between his many enforced flip-flops,
he saw nothing of the U-boat, even though
the navy men had said it was in these very
waters and within a very narrow prescribed
circle.</p>

<p>Presently, as he was swept helter-skelter
along over the sand hummocks by the twisting
waters, he brought up sharp against some
object that projected out of the sand like a
slim piling. Instinctively he flung out an
arm as he was swept close to it. His arm
struck with such a resounding whack that for
the moment the limb felt numb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"What in the name of sense is this?" he
speculated, unable to see for a moment because
of the swirling sand. His mind conjectured
all manner of things.</p>

<p>Clinging tenaciously to his new-found support,
Jay ran his hands up and down the protuberance.
It was smooth and round like
some cylindrical metal object. But what
was it?</p>

<p>Soon there came a rift in the cloud of sand
particles and the filtered sun's rays came down
through the opulent green. In that moment
Jay cleared the sand from the eyes of his
helmet that he might scrutinize the object
more clearly. Turning his gaze upward, he
beheld the boxed lens glass of a periscope&mdash;the
eye of the submarine!</p>

<p>"Great guns! here's the old U-boat buried
to her eyelashes in the bottom of the sea!"
ejaculated the diver, surprised and stunned at
his discovery. There was no doubt of it;
here was the periscopic pole of a submarine
with its great eyes still intact. But what of
the U-boat itself? Was it there under the
sandy floor of the ocean? And by what queer
prank of the tides had it come to be covered
over?</p>

<p>In succession, these questions flitted through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the mind of the lad as he further inspected
his new find. Leaving it, he paced off first
in one direction and then in another, keeping
this up until he had run a radius in every
direction from the periscope pole. But nowhere
was there any trace of a ship's hull
within a reasonable distance of that stranded
ship's eye.</p>

<p>Jay was all excited. To think! He had
located the lost submarine in such an extraordinary
manner!</p>

<p>"I'll have to get out of here, though, and
mighty quick," was his next thought as he
began to feel that queer pain across the eyes
and at the base of the brain that tells a diver
he has had enough for one time of the deadly
sea pressure.</p>

<p>In his excitement he gave his signal line a
mighty jerk. Afterwards they told him he
had signaled the emergency. And they had
been awaiting the signal so long, thinking
some mishap had come to Jay, that they
yanked him up in jig time.</p>

<p>Jay was a sight when he came over the side
of the <i>Nemo</i> again. For one thing he had
stayed too long. His nose was bleeding profusely
and his head was bruised and battered
by the pummeling he had gotten down below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in the embrace of that undertow. But when
they got his helmet off and freshened him up
with cold water and first aid restoratives he
soon rallied again to his normal self.</p>

<p>And then he told them all about the U-boat
in its sepulcher of sand with its periscope
standing out like a gravestone.</p>

<p>"Guess you were right," admitted Commander
Wilberforce as he turned to Captain
Austin, recalling how the latter had suggested
the previous night that the U-boat might
have been covered over by drifted sand, set
in motion by cross currents and undertows.</p>

<p>"And that being the case, I don't see that
there is much that we can do here for the
present," added the Bridgeford official. "It
will be necessary for us to bring down our
new salvage ship before we can do anything
with that U-boat. Of course, we have facilities
for digging into the bottom of the ocean
just as land engineers employ the steam shovel
to excavate a cut or a tunnel. What do you
think?"</p>

<p>Commander Wilberforce heartily agreed
and said he would go ashore at once to
acquaint the department at Washington with
the full facts and ask an authorization on
behalf of the Bridgeford Company for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
employment of their entire resources in exhuming
the buried submarine. In the meanwhile
the <i>Nemo</i> was to return to Bridgeford.</p>

<p>But if Commander Wilberforce and Captain
Austin were through for the present,
Diver Jay Thacker was not. He liked not at
all the prospect of backing off at this stage
of the game, leaving the U-boat possibly to
be buried high over her periscope deeper and
deeper until the new <i>Jules Verne</i> could get
on the job from Bridgeford.</p>

<p>Jay was doing a tall lot of thinking. And
he had formulated in his own mind a plan
of action that he hoped to put into effect with
the aid of Captain Austin. Not even taking
his own chum into his confidence, Jay sought
out the <i>Nemo's</i> chief executive and drew him
below decks for a star-chamber session of his
own making.</p>

<p>Patiently the captain heard Jay through,
shaking his head negatively in disapproval of
the lad's proposition.</p>

<p>"There's no use of your taking any such
risks, and, besides, we'll come back here a
little later with the <i>Jules Verne</i> and worm
our way right into that U-boat."</p>

<p>But Jay was insistent.</p>

<p>"Please, Captain Austin, I'm sure I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
get away with this and rescue those plans
belonging to the government&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Austin, looking over Jay's shoulder,
saw some one approaching and bade the
young diver speak softly of the stolen plans.</p>

<p>The intruder was Weddigen! Jay eyed
him keenly, trying to fathom whether the
burly diver had overhead the remark. A
cynical smile played at the corners of Carl's
mouth and he smirked at Jay in a leering
way.</p>

<p>"Well, all right, Thacker, I suppose you
will have your own way," decided the ship's
captain. "Go ahead, I'll wait the afternoon
out for you; but, remember, we weigh anchor
for home to-night."</p>

<p>Jay climbed on deck and prepared again to
don his armor.</p>

<p>"Bring me a crowbar and that old mushroom
anchor that lies up front in the forward
compartment," he asked of one of the deckmen.</p>

<p>Dick was assisting his chum to get into his
diving suit.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do this time?"
asked Dick inquisitively.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got an idea and I want to see
how it works out," replied Jay. "That freak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
undertow is doing some funny stunts and I
think I can use it to suit my purposes. I'll
let you know after I've had another look at
that periscope pole."</p>

<p>Pretty soon Jay was over the side again and
dangling in the water, carrying the crowbar
in one hand and the mushroom anchor in the
other. Instantly his feet touched bottom, he
set off in the direction of the periscope and
soon came upon it by intuitively guiding along
the course that he knew would take him to
the goal of his aspiration. The water was
fairly clear and the undertow still setting
strong along the ocean bed.</p>

<p>"Now we'll see," he murmured, as he set
down the anchor within easy reach and took
the crowbar, commencing to dig directly
alongside the periscope pole. It is not easy
thus to dig on the sandy bottom of the sea;
one must go in sidewise with a due allowance
for the currents instead of directly down.</p>

<p>Little by little the sand was dislodged and
turned away. And so soon as it became loosened
up and was stirred around the water
dragged at it and skitted it away freakily,
dissolving it into particles that filled all the
sea round about the diver. Pretty soon Jay
was the center of a veritable submarine sand
tornado.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good enough; just what I wanted," he
chuckled.</p>

<p>All at once as he was digging away the
crowbar struck something hard. With a firm
impact it brought up against a solid substance.
The diver's own buoyancy and the swing of
the rolling sea kept him from digging with
much force, but pecking away with determination
Jay soon accomplished his purpose, and
that was to make a considerable excavation
over the hard metallic substance that his
crowbar had encountered.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Submarine," he
laughed. For what he had encountered with
his crowbar was nothing more or less than
the top of the U-boat's conning tower!</p>

<p>Setting the anchor in the hole, he lashed
the crowbar to his body again and gave the
signal to be hoisted.</p>

<p>"See you in the morning," he called to the
sunken submarine.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER X
<span class="ch">Caught with the Goods</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was morning. Captain Austin, won
over by the arguments of Jay Thacker,
one of his crack divers, had decided to
postpone the return trip to Bridgeford twenty-four
hours in order to give the Brighton lad a
chance to work out a plan he had hatched
while exploring the wreck of the submerged
U-boat.</p>

<p>"You say you want us to anchor directly
over the submarine and play you out a hundred
feet of hydraulic hose?" asked the captain
of the <i>Nemo</i> as he greeted Jay and Dick
on deck after morning mess.</p>

<p>"Right you are," chirped Jay, "and I want
the hose attached to the air pump just the
same as you hitch up my own air lines&mdash;only
I want all the pressure of air you can put
behind this new hose line."</p>

<p>"You shall have it, my boy," replied the
captain, and gave orders to various members
of his crew to rig out the apparatus for which
Jay had called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's all this hose line?" chortled Larry
Seymour as he watched Jay preparing again
to go over the side of the <i>Nemo</i>. "Looks as
though you are going down to spray the mermaids
with a little hot air."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, kiddo; it's a vacuum
cleaner to scrub up Father Neptune's parlor,"
remarked Dick, who had been let in on Jay's
plans.</p>

<p>Weddigen sauntered up like a pouter pigeon.</p>

<p>"Nothing new about this," said he to members
of the crew standing beside him. "This
bird Thacker knows his onion; he's simply
taking down a line of hose and proposes to
bore his way into the stranded submarine with
a line of compressed air. All you got to do is
turn on the air, point the nozzle of the hose
into the sand, and away she goes."</p>

<p>Jay, getting ready to adjust his helmet,
overheard the remark. How did Weddigen
know it was a U-boat?</p>

<p>"You have it O. K., Weddigen; that's just
exactly what I'm going to try and do," he
replied pleasantly. At the same time he was
asking himself: "Has Weddigen overheard
about the plans in the U-boat?"</p>

<p>It was a bold plan, but quite a feasible plan
after all. Taking advantage of the undertow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that snatched up every loosened particle of
sand and scurried it away, Jay proposed to
do a little excavating in the neighborhood of
the U-boat and leave it to the currents themselves
to exhume the lost ship&mdash;at least to
free it far enough for the divers to get inside
and salvage the plans so much wanted by the
U. S. Government.</p>

<p>And now Jay was ready to be off. His new
"vacuum cleaner" was ready and the air
pump working smoothly.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you," called out Captain
Austin as Dick prepared to clamp on his
chum's helmet.</p>

<p>The youth smiled and in a moment shuffled
to the side and was over and gone deep down
into the embrace of the green sea, his air hose
fastened at his belt. Pretty soon he was on
bottom and groping his way along from hummock
to hummock, now stumbling and now
lifted by the whirling currents.</p>

<p>Presently he came upon the periscope pole
and the mushroom anchor he had left below
the previous night. But now the anchor sat
deep down in a wide depression that opened
out of the floor of the sea like the crater of a
volcano.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul if that undertow hasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
been working for me all night," he observed
while noting that the sand had been scooped
out in huge quantities in every direction
radiating from the periscope pole.</p>

<p>Which made it that much easier for the
submarine excavator. The digging, of course,
but not the actual work; for the deadly currents
were dragging the youth to and fro
until he reeled and tottered like a drunken
man. But Jay had come prepared so that he
would not again be subjected to the terrific
mauling he had received before. This time
he had piled on lead until he was heavily
weighted down. A canvas belt, slung from
hips to armpits, with pockets, held close to
fifty pounds of metal. In addition he had
fastened around each ankle a bag containing
another twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p>As he prepared to swing his air hose into
action Jay found the sea clutching and tearing
viciously at his own air and signal lines and
he made sure that they were intact and working
perfectly before he gave the signal for
the air to be turned into the "spray" line
that he carried.</p>

<p>At last the youth was ready for his experiment.
Jay had no idea how his plan would
turn out, for, while he had heard of this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of work and knew of its practicability, he had
never tried it out for himself. It was his
purpose to start the sand shifting in the
belief that once the movement was under way
the freakish undertow and cross-currents
would come to his assistance and facilitate
the task of unearthing the U-boat.</p>

<p>"Here goes," he cried as he sat down on
the sandy bottom and, holding the nozzle
of the hose away from him at an oblique
angle of forty degrees, turned on the air full
force.</p>

<p>Instantly the sea began to boil up around
him like a young geyser. The sand was swept
and swirled in every direction by the column
of compressed air that was boring relentlessly
into everything it touched. The young diver
could feel his feet sinking slowly into an aperture
as the sea bottom was scooped up and
distributed into the yellow clouds that filled
all the space of water around the periscope
pole.</p>

<p>A new danger confronted the youth. Unless
he exercised extreme caution he might dig
his own grave. The shifting sand might
collect around his own body and imbed him
quickly unless he kept it shifting away from
him instead of around him. The thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
being buried alive made him shudder for an
instant, but he dismissed it and set himself
carefully to keep the moving sand in front
instead of behind him.</p>

<p>He resolved to keep on the move, holding
the air hose ever far in front and drawing
himself, as best he could shift the weights that
held him down, in a wide circle around the
periscope pole, throwing the sand off to the
left. In this way he hoped to make an excavation
that would gradually bring the conning
tower of the U-boat above the level of the
sea bottom. Backing steadily all the time
on the circumference of his circle, he kept
the sand moving ever outward; and move it
did with the assistance of the undertow that
aided and abetted the work of the air hose
just as Jay had anticipated it would do.</p>

<p>Despite the perils of the undertaking Jay
persisted and soon had worked himself completely
around to the starting-point, a complete
circle having the periscope pole of the
U-boat as the hub of the imaginative wheel.
By the feel of it under his feet and by thrusting
his right foot out into the hole that he had
dug Jay could tell his efforts had not been
in vain. Considerable sand must have been
shifted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>He decided to turn off the compressed air
and await the clearing of the water so that
he could see what he had accomplished. He
had by now been down for considerable time
and was commencing to feel the effects of
his hard toil, the wear and tear of the sea, and
the weight of his added incumbrances. Nevertheless,
since his breathing was still free
and easy he decided he could risk a few more
minutes anyway to view the results of his
handiwork.</p>

<p>By and by the sand clouds began to settle
and the yellow sedimentation to subside.
Imagine his joy when he found that he had
successfully dug a great excavation right over
the deck of the U-boat amidships, with the
conning tower standing out entirely freed of
all sand investiture.</p>

<p>"Good enough," he told himself gleefully.
"And now to get inside the U-boat before the
sands shift back again."</p>

<p>Reluctantly he gave the signal to be raised
away after lashing the air hose with which
he had successfully accomplished the task fast
to the conning tower of the U-boat.</p>

<p>By now he could feel his heart pounding
fiercely while a fitful darkness obscured his
sight. Well he knew these symptoms&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
had stayed down longer than he should have.
But with his signal for a lift he felt the cables
tighten and then he was swept along through
the water toward the surface. Soon they
were hauling him over the side of the <i>Nemo</i>
just when his senses were reeling.</p>

<p>"Boy, you stayed too long," he heard
Captain Austin saying as the helmet was lifted
and he breathed again the pure air of the
surface.</p>

<p>He could only nod a reply. But within a
few minutes he was himself again and able to
talk.</p>

<p>"What success, lad?" Captain Austin was
eager to know how he had gotten along.</p>

<p>Jay told him the story; how he had utilized
the air hose in excavating the U-boat and
how it now lay all exposed in its hastily
improvised crater.</p>

<p>"Some one had better go down right away
and see if they can pry into that conning
tower," he counseled. "No telling when
those sands will commence to shift back
again with the undertow."</p>

<p>Immediately Dick Monaghan and Carl
Weddigen stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I'd like to take a shot at it,"
offered Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give me a chance, Captain; remember
how I got along with the <i>Dominion</i>," pleaded
Weddigen.</p>

<p>Other members of the crew who were divers
offered to take Jay's place and the captain
for a moment was in a quandary.</p>

<p>"Guess you better go down, Weddigen, and
see what you can do by way of prodding that
conning tower open," the <i>Nemo's</i> executive
decided. "You have big powerful arms and
good lungs." At the same time, Austin
winked at Jay, thinking Weddigen knew
nothing of the plans in the U-boat.</p>

<p>Turning to Dick the captain said:</p>

<p>"I'll send you down after Weddigen works
awhile, and we'll see what the two of you
can do."</p>

<p>So Weddigen hastily climbed into his diving
suit and made ready to go. Weddigen went
equipped with tools that he hoped to use in
forcing an entrance into the submarine. He
took along with him also the extra air hose
since it was possible the sand was shifting
again and he might find it necessary to do
some more digging.</p>

<p>After he had gone Jay and Dick engaged in
earnest conversation.</p>

<p>"That fellow's not to be trusted," remarked
Jay tartly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"He may undo all that you've done," added
Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes, or get into that U-boat and make
away with those navy plans." Jay had seen
enough of Weddigen to give him the idea
that the big fellow had ulterior motives behind
his activities with the Bridgeford Salvage
Company.</p>

<p>After half an hour's wait Captain Austin
told Dick to go ahead and get ready for a
descent to the U-boat.</p>

<p>"See how Weddigen's getting along. Maybe
you can recover those plans yourself."</p>

<p>The captain had confided to the two divers,
Jay and Dick, that the coveted plans were
contained in a stout steel box that would be
found in a locker in the submarine's wireless
chamber just forward of the main turret.</p>

<p>Dick was glad of the chance to get the
assignment. So far he had not had an
opportunity to prove his ability as a diver to
Captain Austin and he was anxious to make
good. What a fine thing if he could be instrumental
in reclaiming for the United States
Government the long lost plans and scientific
formulas! It had been hinted that among
other things, the stolen plans included the
formula for manufacture of the deadly gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that U. S. chemists had discovered just before
the close of the war.</p>

<p>"I'll certainly do my level best," soliloquized
Dick as he floundered along on the
sea bottom in the direction of the U-boat.</p>

<p>Very soon he came in sight of it. The
sun, shining strong on the surface of the sea,
lit up the whole area of clear water so that
he was able to see quite a distance in front of
him.</p>

<p>Through the green haze of the sea he discerned
suddenly the figure of another diver.
He was dragging after him a long rectangular
box of some kind. Undoubtedly it was
Weddigen! But what was he doing and what
was the chest that he dragged with so much
effort?</p>

<p>"The plans!" gasped Dick. In an instant
it was clearly revealed to him. Weddigen
had succeeded in getting into the submarine
and had salvaged the stolen plans!</p>

<p>What was Weddigen doing now? Dick
stopped short in his tracks to watch the
maneuvers of the other diver.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XI
<span class="ch">The Spy!</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">PEERING intently through the water
Dick watched every move of Weddigen.
The latter had knelt on the sandy
bottom and was tinkering with the steel chest.
His back was turned to the Brighton youth
and he, to all intents, had no knowledge of
the proximity of the latter.</p>

<p>And then Dick made an astounding discovery.
Weddigen had unfastened the extra
air hose from his belt, turned on the air and
was digging a hole in the sand some ten or
fifteen yards away from the submarine. A
cloud of sediment was stirred up by the air
which for the time served the purpose of
hiding the diver at his work.</p>

<p>Dick's first impulse was to move forward
hastily and make known his presence, thinking
perhaps Weddigen was having trouble lugging
the chest and needed assistance. But then,
it occurred to him, why would Carl be digging
a hole with the air line when he had already
salvaged the precious box? Why had he not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
gripped it with a steel cable and sent it aloft
to the <i>Nemo</i>?</p>

<p>"By jove! I know what he's doing,"
exclaimed Dick to himself. "He's trying to
lose those plans under the floor of the sea
rather than give them back to the government!"</p>

<p>The youth saw red on the instant. A
traitor to America! An enemy of the United
States Government who, rather than return
the plans that he had found, was trying to
cover them up where he might return later
and dig for them at his leisure.</p>

<p>Just for an instant Dick was undecided
whether to return at once to the <i>Nemo</i> and
report what he had seen or stay and see it
through to the limit. To grapple with
Weddigen here under the sea was next to
impossible. Heavily accoutred as he was
with diving paraphernalia and weighed down
by additional anchors, he could hope to gain
nothing by forcibly encountering the big
diver in front of him.</p>

<p>He decided to wait until Weddigen had
stopped digging and the water cleared again.
In the meantime he moved closer, thinking
perhaps when Weddigen found that he was
being observed he would switch his tactics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and order the steel chest with its precious
documents hoisted away. It was a trying
moment for the lad and he bit his lip to think
that he had no submarine weapon of any
kind that would enable him to challenge the
traitor and compel him to desist. But it
was a time for quick thinking and direct
action, and he firmly resolved to make the
best of the situation.</p>

<p>Before long the stirring of the sands ceased
and the water began to clear. Dick by now
was no further away from Weddigen than
ten or fifteen feet. But Weddigen was still
crouched with his back to the newcomer and
all unmindful of Dick's presence. And then,
in one quick glance, Dick discerned that
Weddigen had dug his hole, and was dragging
the steel chest into it, preparatory to covering
it up.</p>

<p>"The dirty dog!" hissed the Brighton
youth, instinctively clenching his fists.</p>

<p>On the instant Dick was minded to grapple
with the fellow at all hazards and wrestle with
him for possession of the steel box. The only
thing in the way of a weapon that he carried
was a short, slender crowbar that he had used
to facilitate walking, while at the feet of
Weddigen lay the various tools that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
brought along to force his way into the
U-boat.</p>

<p>And then Dick saw his opportunity! Weddigen
was still unmindful of the presence of
another diver, so intent was he on getting
the treasure box buried. Why not steal up
behind Carl, grasp his signal lines and signal
for the emergency lift before the scheming
diver could interfere? Up he would go,
leaving the unattached strong box behind
him!</p>

<p>"I'll do it, so help me!" the youth exclaimed
in sheer delight.</p>

<p>Stealthily he approached, taking every precaution
not to stir up any more of the sea
bottom than he could help in order not to
apprise Weddigen that he was so close at
hand. The latter by now had the box in
position and was prepared to swing the air
hose in action. In a moment or two the
precious plans would be gone again&mdash;covered
up by a dastardly enemy of America!</p>

<p>Dick was almost on top of Weddigen
before the latter wheeled suddenly to find
that he had company. But as Carl swung
round in his heavy shoes Dick took one
desperate lunge through the water in the
direction of Weddigen's helmet. His aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
was true and his momentum despite his
weights sufficient to carry him to the mark.
Eagerly he clutched the signal lines over
Carl's head.</p>

<p>Weddigen saw the move and divined the
intent&mdash;but all too late. As Dick's fingers
closed over the conspirator's signal lines he
gave one mighty tug and instantly released
his hold, knowing full well what would happen.
And happen it did! Yanked off his feet by
willing hands on the deck of the <i>Nemo</i> the
hapless Carl Weddigen was carried swiftly up
through the swirling currents, leaving the
salvage that he had recovered and tried to
lose again behind him at the feet of Dick
Monaghan.</p>

<p>It had been Dick's only play and he had
seized his opportunity, just as at Brighton he
had recovered many a fumble on the football
field by quick thinking.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" he murmured in prayerful
gratitude.</p>

<p>Dick now was free to make fast the strong
box and hoist it away. Taking a short length
of chain from his belt he trussed up the box
securely, affixed one of his cables and gave the
signal to raise away. Up went the chest
over his head, and then he gathered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
abandoned tools that Weddigen had left
behind him, strapping them to his sides.</p>

<p>"Now for the <i>Nemo</i> and the story of Mr.
Carl Weddigen and his despicable infamy
before he makes a getaway."</p>

<p>Presently Dick was back again on the deck
of the <i>Nemo</i>, still fresh in body and spirit
and none the worse for his rather long stay
on the sea bottom.</p>

<p>So impatient was the lad to be released from
his diving armor that he could scarce contain
himself. Glancing through the eye ports of
his helmet he noted that Weddigen was being
relieved of his armor, and that he was scowling
fiercely at those who were assisting him.</p>

<p>Captain Austin and Jay Thacker were
standing close by Dick, waiting only his
release to congratulate him on the recovery
of the government formulas and charts from
the sunken U-boat. They had no idea as yet,
of course, as to how they had been reclaimed,
for Weddigen had given them no tangible
story. Instead he had proved evasive.</p>

<p>"Good work, boy," Dick heard Captain
Austin say, as his helmet was lifted. A
proffered hand was extended him.</p>

<p>"Gee, chum, I sure am proud of you," Jay
was smiling&mdash;all smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>But not so Dick. Anger blazed in his eyes
and he emerged from his diving accoutrements
with something like the ferocity of a beast of
prey released from its trap.</p>

<p>While the captain of the <i>Nemo</i> and Diver
Thacker looked on dumbfounded Dick fairly
leaped across the deck in the direction of
Weddigen and shook a fist under that diver's
nose.</p>

<p>"You dirty dog of a traitor; don't think
you will get away with it this time."</p>

<p>Weddigen recoiled under the fury of the
verbal attack, his own teeth showing like a
whipped cur that has been backed in a corner
by a giant mastiff.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a great hubbub on
deck, members of the crew jostling about
just as a crowd collects on a public thoroughfare
at the least sign of a commotion. It was
not the first time that Diver Weddigen was
thus confronted by one of the Brighton boys.
Sailors of the <i>Nemo</i> recalled on the instant
the scene after the recovery of the diamonds
from the <i>Dominion</i>.</p>

<p>"You are a spy in the service of the German
secret service and a cowardly villain to
the very core of your heart."</p>

<p>Dick Monaghan was fairly railing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
cowering diver. By now Captain Austin had
edged up closer with Jay Thacker right at his
heels.</p>

<p>"Captain Austin, this man Weddigen recovered
that chest of government plans from the
U-boat; but he was trying to get rid of them
again. He knew that Jay Thacker and I
would stay here as long as you would let us
in an attempt to reclaim them, and that in
the event of our failure to salvage them the
U. S. Navy would have persisted until it had
gotten them back again. And so he tried to
do away with them when he realized that it
was impossible now ever to get these plans
out of this country."</p>

<p>Captain Austin stepped away aghast with
rage.</p>

<p>"What! Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Like a human machine gun Dick rattled off
the story of what had happened on the floor
of the ocean; how he had come upon Weddigen
tugging away at the chest; how he had stood
watch while the diver made ready to bury the
precious documents, and how he had intervened
just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>Through the whole recital Weddigen cringed
like an animal afraid. His face was ghastly
white, but with it all he endeavored to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
quiet and self-possessed, ready to take advantage
of any opening.</p>

<p>"I've suspected him from the very beginning,"
Dick was saying. "The first day you
broached this proposition to us, Mr. Thacker
found him spying at the keyhole of your office.
Only yesterday, when Mr. Thacker was telling
you how he planned to get into the U-boat,
this chap Weddigen bobbed up unexpectedly."</p>

<p>Captain Austin was nodding in a knowing
way.</p>

<p>At this juncture some one else took a hand
in the proceedings. Jay Thacker stepped
forward.</p>

<p>"Captain Austin, I'm neither a quitter nor
a squealer," he began. Just for a moment he
paused, and then resumed.</p>

<p>"You recall the scene on the day that we
came back with the diamonds from the
<i>Dominion</i>&mdash;or rather, when Weddigen came
back with the diamonds. Weddigen was
accused by Larry Seymour of having stolen
some of the glittering gems and secreted them
in a slit pocket in the side of his diving suit.
Weddigen explained that the chest had come
open and that he had slipped some of the
jewels into his pocket only when they were
in danger of being lost."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Nemo</i> remembered it all.</p>

<p>"Very well, captain, I had intended always
to keep silent," continued Jay. "You seemed
satisfied to take his word for it; and I did
not feel like speaking out for fear you and some
of the fellows would think I was only jealous
because Weddigen had gotten the diamonds
and I had not. But now I'm going to speak
out and tell the truth."</p>

<p>Jay looked full into the face of Weddigen,
fearlessly and intently. In return he was met
with a bitter look of scorn.</p>

<p>Pointing his finger directly at the big diver,
Jay said:</p>

<p>"Weddigen stole those diamonds. By the
light of his own flash I saw him break open
the chest in the captain's cabin of the <i>Dominion</i>
and transfer some of those sparklers
to his pockets. As God is my judge, I saw
this man take those diamonds."</p>

<p>The hubbub increased. The crew of the
<i>Nemo</i> seemed about to leap on the accused
diver.</p>

<p>"Since he didn't get away with the theft
because of the alertness of Seymour," Jay
continued, "I decided to let the matter go by.
But now that he's been caught again, and this
time in a dastardly effort against the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that we all love, I'm telling the whole story.
He's a thief and a traitor, and Dick Monaghan
and I have the goods on him."</p>

<p>Jay's dramatic climax in high-pitched voice
with an extended hand that shook with rage
aroused the crew of the <i>Nemo</i> to a wild frenzy
of rage. With one accord they moved toward
the indicted diver. A traitor to the United
States! More yet, an emissary of the vaunted
German secret service working right in their
very midst!</p>

<p>"String him up! Give him his due! Kill
him!" the cries were intermingled with the
hoarse guttural exclamations of the <i>Nemo's</i>
crew. They were minded on the moment to
mete out justice themselves&mdash;the mob-rule
spirit when it has been whetted to white heat
passion.</p>

<p>In this trying situation, Captain Austin,
exponent of law and order, took a hand.
Enraged as he was at the revelations concerning
Weddigen, he was determined there should
be no informal lynching party aboard his craft.
Better to make a prisoner of the man and
turn him over to the United States Government
for a trial that would bring out interesting
information and certainly result in
punishment of a fitting nature being visited
upon this miserable spy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Whipping out his revolver the captain
advanced through the crowd to the side of
the dismayed diver.</p>

<p>"He's my prisoner, boys; I'll just lock him
up and take him back to Bridgeford with us,
where we'll turn him over to Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>As for Dick and Jay, they were thinking
not so much of the fate of the discomfited
diver, but of the precious government plans
and formulas that had been saved from falling
into the hands of foreign and unfriendly
powers! Weddigen had overheard and knew
all the time!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XII
<span class="ch">Introducing the "Jules Verne"</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">"ALL out for the <i>Jules Verne</i>!"</p>

<p>A familiar voice sounded in the
ears of Dick Monaghan as he
swung up through the big shipyard at Bridgeford
bound for the office of Superintendent
Brown in the hope that he would find Captain
Austin and his own chum, Jay Thacker, and
learn from them some interesting news concerning
the next move to be made in the
game of deep-sea salvage.</p>

<p>"All out for the <i>Jules Verne</i>!" It was a
familiar phrase to every Brighton student.
At the academy, it was always "all out"
when the boys quit their books at night for a
romp in the corridors before "lights out."</p>

<p>"All out yourself, old chappie," retorted
Dick. "And what's the good news this
morning?"</p>

<p>"The good news is that the <i>Jules Verne</i> is
ready for her maiden trip out into Long Island
Sound, and we are bound thither, old boy,
by the light of this afternoon's sun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick was pleased. They had been back
nearly two weeks now from Cape May and
the recovery of government plans from the
lost U-boat. There had been some tedious
delay in fitting out the new salvage ship with
its finishing touches, and the inactivity had
tried the mettle of the two lads.</p>

<p>Eagerly they set their steps toward the
offices of "Montey" Brown, the yard superintendent,
intent upon procuring further and
definite information. On the way they were
accosted by "Laughing Larry" Seymour&mdash;"the
original optimist" the boys had labeled
him.</p>

<p>"Look who's here!" chortled Jay as Larry
came swinging along.</p>

<p>For once the volatile Seymour was repressed.</p>

<p>"Heard the news yet today?" Larry was
all earnestness.</p>

<p>"Sure, we know all about the <i>Jules Verne</i>&mdash;"
Jay was in excellent spirits and not to be
daunted by the changed demeanor of the
usually debonair Seymour.</p>

<p>"Naw, I don't mean the <i>Jules Verne</i>! I
mean this."</p>

<p>Larry snatched a newspaper from his pocket
and was pointing to a glaring front page
headline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Spy Suspect Escapes Receiving Ship
<i>Exeter's</i> Brig at Charlestown Navy Yard in
Boston&mdash;Carl Weddigen, Believed to be German
Secret Service Emissary, Makes Getaway
on Eve of Trial."</p>

<p>It was a copy of the Providence <i>Journal</i>
that had come into Bridgeford by the morning
mail. Seymour was ready to "blow up"
with indignation.</p>

<p>"What do you know about that!" he was
groaning.</p>

<p>Jay and Dick, their faces buried in the
outspread sheet, read every detail of the news
item. How their erstwhile shipmate, Carl
Weddigen, he of the diamond-theft fame
and the U-boat plot, had slipped his chains
at Boston, dropped over the side of the <i>Exeter</i>
and successfully made his getaway. Within
a few days he was to have been haled before
a Naval Board of Inquiry; and both Jay and
Dick were to have appeared as witnesses in
the case.</p>

<p>"Out of luck!" expostulated Jay. "Just
after we round up that bird&mdash;then they let
him slip away. Fine state of affairs."</p>

<p>Weddigen was soon forgotten in the plans
for going aboard the <i>Jules Verne</i> and testing
her out on the initial voyage. Captain Austin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
meeting the three lads near the drydock, told
them they should report for duty at seven
o'clock the next morning. Jay had heard
that they would go out that same afternoon;
but now their chief executive told them it
would be morning before they would get their
first peek at the new salvage ship.</p>

<p>The hours dragged slowly, so impatient
were the youths to see the <i>Jules Verne</i> at last.
They had heard so much about her and
speculated so much on the kind of ship that
it might be and how it would operate. Even
carefree Larry Seymour, not much given
to the serious side of life, avowed for once all
this secrecy had "got his goat."</p>

<p>"Must be something wonderful's all I can
say," he laughed with a toss of the head.</p>

<p>"And tomorrow we're to find out all about
it," Jay could hardly wait.</p>

<p>Morning found the three youths on hand
early. Fismes, the war dog, accompanied
them to the yard. Jay had wanted to take
the pet along on the <i>Nemo</i> as a mascot, but
it had been decided there was no space on the
under-water craft for a dog. Now it might
be different; for the <i>Jules Verne</i> was a surface
cruising craft from which under-water operations
were conducted&mdash;that much the boys
had wormed out of Captain Austin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cap" himself was waiting to greet the
lads and escort them aboard the <i>Jules Verne</i>.</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho! what have we here?" interposed
Captain Austin as he wheeled to look the dog
over.</p>

<p>"Some tramp dog that followed you fellows
in?"</p>

<p>Jay was quick to tell the story of the famous
dog of war, and to introduce Fismes formally
to the Bridgeford Yard official.</p>

<p>"Good enough, old boy," was Cap's greeting
as he took the extended paw of the dog.</p>

<p>"And now you shall come right aboard
the <i>Jules Verne</i> with us. We need a mascot
for this new ship. I know of none better,
and forthwith propose you as a member of
the crew. What do you say, boys?"</p>

<p>Jay and Dick, who shared the pet between
them, heartily agreed, and Jay told how he
had really wanted to take Fismes along on
the <i>Nemo</i>, but had desisted, knowing there
would not be room.</p>

<p>"But there's plenty of room on the <i>Jules
Verne</i>. Come along, fellows; let's be on our
way." So saying, the four deep-sea navigators
set out for the new craft, closely pursued
by a shaggy brown dog, who, stiff and
proud, walked like an animal all conceited
over new honors heaped upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here she is all ready for us," announced
Captain Austin as they came at last in sight
of the <i>Jules Verne</i>.</p>

<p>Both Brighton lads stopped short in their
tracks. They had expected to see something
pretentious. Instead, here was anchored a
flat wide-beamed vessel that at first glance
looked for all the world like a car-float with
the superstructure of a ferry boat. It might
have been a houseboat at one time in its
career.</p>

<p>But what particularly struck the fancy of
the boys was a strange ram-like nose that
projected straight out from the bow of this
odd-looking craft. At this distance it looked
like a series of huge steel cistern sections
linked together after the fashion of a long
sewer system. For approximately a hundred
feet this cylindrical projection extended out
from the bow of the <i>Jules Verne</i>. Less than
a third of it was exposed to view, the remainder
being under water. At the end it terminated
in a queer flatiron-shaped turret
something like eight or ten feet across at the
back and tapering forward to a thin prow of
inches.</p>

<p>Truly this was a strange looking outfit!
Never in all their maritime experience had
the boys seen anything like it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"You sure have one on me," faltered Dick
as he surveyed the craft.</p>

<p>Jay was shaking his head too. "Might be
the houseboat on the Styx so far as my store
of knowledge is concerned."</p>

<p>Captain Austin turned to Larry Seymour.
"What do you think of her?"</p>

<p>"Nix for me, Captain; you have me buffaloed,"
was all Larry could hazard.</p>

<p>Captain Austin laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"I thought you chaps would be surprised.
Well, now let's see. The <i>Jules Verne</i> is the
mother ship"&mdash;he pointed out the "houseboat"
that had first caught the eyes of the
boys. "She is nothing more than an old Fall
River liner that we bought in and converted
into our own uses. She is simply the base
of operations. We live on the <i>Jules Verne</i>.
She takes us wherever we want to go and
she is entirely seaworthy, I assure you.</p>

<p>"Now, look at the access tube." The
captain was pointing now to the long cylindrical
tube that led away forward from the
bow of the <i>Jules Verne</i>. "That is the way
we get into the <i>Nautilus</i>. Oh, yes, the
<i>Nautilus</i> is really the big secret of our plan.
It is the small diving compartment that sets
out there in the water."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean the flatiron-shaped section
nearly awash?" queried Dick.</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied the captain. "Call it a
diving bell if you will. What we have here is
two distinct vessels connected by a long
passageway. 'The Subway' as Superintendent
Brown calls it. First we go aboard the
<i>Jules Verne</i>. Then we find the lost ship on
the bottom of the sea that we want to work
on. When we are ready we lower the access
tube and the <i>Nautilus</i> right over the wreck.
Down goes the tube. Down we climb just
like walking down an enclosed ladder.
Through the air-lock&mdash;and there we are in
the <i>Nautilus</i>! Don't you get it?"</p>

<p>Jay and Dick nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"Tell us more about the <i>Nautilus</i>," asked
Dick inquisitively.</p>

<p>"Well, the <i>Nautilus</i> is nothing more or less
than a submarine diving chamber," explained
Austin. "It is set on the end of the access
tube by means of a huge differential that
enables it to work back and forth like a flexible
hinge. Under the <i>Nautilus</i> and under
the access tube are ballast tanks. You boys
who have been in the submarine and the
diving business in the Navy know how easily
that works. We raise or lower the diving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
compartment simply by 'trimming,' or blowing
the tanks. In case the ballast apparatus
gets out of commission, we have the <i>Nautilus</i>
suspended on cables. They will bring her up
again if she gets stuck down there."</p>

<p>"Oh, I commence to see it now," interrupted
Jay. "The mother boat, or <i>Jules Verne</i>, is
like your shoulder. The access tube through
which you effect an entrance into the <i>Nautilus</i>
is like your arm. The <i>Nautilus</i> is like your
hand. You raise or lower at will, and you
can put the <i>Nautilus</i> down in the water at a
distance equal to the length of the access tube,
or arm. Isn't that it?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, my boy," countered "Cap"
Austin. "And can't you see the advantages of
such an equipment? Heretofore, we have had
to send you divers down to go groping around
over the bottom of the sea after we found
our quarry. You had to prod and dig and
scratch around to find out the condition of
the lost ship, how best she was to be entered,
and all that. And by that time, you were
pretty well played out and had to stop until
you got in good trim again."</p>

<p>"To say nothing of the tides and the storms
that kept pulling us away from our work,"
added Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right you are," continued the captain.
"But now all that is done away with. When
we come to a wreck now we lower the <i>Nautilus</i>;
you chaps go down with us and from the
ports of the <i>Nautilus</i> we inspect the wreck
without one of you having to step a foot on
the bottom of the sea. When we have looked
her over carefully and are all ready to get
down to work, then we can let you out the
bottom of the <i>Nautilus</i>, instead of sending
you over the sides of the <i>Jules Verne</i>. What
do you think of that? Think of it! You are
already down in the sea a hundred feet or
more. You are not only conserving your
strength, but you are much safer than when
out in diving armor floundering around in
quest of your prey."</p>

<p>"What is the <i>Nautilus</i> like inside, and how
does she operate?" Dick, mechanically inclined,
was eager to solve the whole of this riddle.</p>

<p>"You shall know intimately for yourselves
within a very short time," answered his captain.
"We are going right aboard now, and
as soon as Superintendent "Montey" Brown
and a number of officials higher up come
along we are going to cast off and go out in
the Sound to make our first practical tests."</p>

<p>That was good news to the Brighton boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and Larry Seymour. Headed by Captain
Austin and followed by their good friend
Fismes, they crossed the gangplank and
stepped on the deck of the <i>Jules Verne</i>.</p>

<p>"Not made for grace or beauty, but a very
practical old craft," remarked "Cap" as he
led the way forward. The new recruits were
anxious to learn all about the new diving
operations as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the rest of the party came
aboard and the <i>Jules Verne</i> slipped out into
Long Island Sound&mdash;ready for business!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XIII
<span class="ch">Diving De Luxe</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">"ALL right, boys; now for the <i>Nautilus</i>."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Captain
Austin, hailing the Brighton boys and their
chum Larry Seymour. The three youths,
with Fismes at their backs, had been sitting
on a forward promenade as the <i>Jules Verne</i>
worked her way through the shipping that
lined the Bridgeford harbor entrance. By
now the new diving ship had escaped the
confines of the harbor and was out part way
between the dimly distant shores of Long
Island and the state of Connecticut. Occasionally
a train on the New Haven flitted
along the far shore line. A passenger steamship
from New York to Boston via the Sound
had but passed.</p>

<p>"Here's where you get your first peep at
the <i>Nautilus</i>," said Captain Austin, as the
boys climbed down the companionway to the
main deck. Superintendent Brown nodded
to the three youths and then in turn introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
them to a party of gentlemen composed
of officials of the Bridgeford Company and
others who had been interested in the formation
of a syndicate to back the new diving
ventures. Members of the party had heard
of the boys' war record, and also of their
work on the <i>Dominion</i>, and on the U-boat
off Cape May. The lads found themselves
the objects of much attention.</p>

<p>Captain Austin confided the information
that this first trip of the <i>Jules Verne</i> was to
acquaint all hands around with the operation
of the apparatus. In other words, it was to
be a demonstration that would point out the
feasibilities and practical virtues of the new
plan. He told them that his company still
held the assignment for the recovery of the
gold from the old <i>Dominion</i>, but reclaiming
the gold bullion was a man-size job and they
had decided to use the <i>Jules Verne</i> for it if
the practical tests turned out satisfactorily.</p>

<p>"You boys come along now," sang out
Captain Austin as he climbed into a huge
hatch standing above deck and lowered away
into the depths below. Without further
ceremony the boys followed suit, Jay going
first, followed by Dick and Larry. Fismes
had to stay behind, but barked furiously to
manifest his displeasure at being deserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Lowering away from handrail to handrail
down the wide hatch, "Cap" Austin arrived
finally at the bottom of the opening, closely
pursued by the others.</p>

<p>"Low bridge now, fellows," he cautioned.</p>

<p>And low bridge it was as the party entered
the access tube. Like an oblique ladder
leading downward the tube stretched away
into the sea. The steel piping was less than
four feet in diameter, and the only way to
negotiate it was to duck down almost on all
fours and make your way along laboriously
like a telephone repairman in a conduit.
Electric lights were stationed at intervals
along the way to light up the submarine tunnel.</p>

<p>"Keep your head down, Fritzie boy, or
you'll get an awful bump on the cranium,"
cautioned the ship's captain.</p>

<p>"Now we are going into the air-lock
chamber, boys," he told them. "We are
down below the surface of the Sound something
like eighty-five feet. When we get on
the deck of the <i>Nautilus</i> we will be down an
even hundred feet. Follow me right through."</p>

<p>In response to the captain's tapping on a
huge port immediately to his right it had
swung open like the fire door of a huge locomotive.
There, in the encircling frame, was
the face of Superintendent Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Welcome, boys. 'Will you step into my
parlor?' said the spider to the fly."</p>

<p>The yard official was all smiles as he
greeted the boys.</p>

<p>Captain Austin set his foot through the
aperture and crawled through into the adjoining
chamber alongside the superintendent.
The boys followed suit as rapidly as they
could.</p>

<p>They found themselves now in a narrow
little prison not more than four feet high, six
or seven feet long, and about two feet wide.
With difficulty the five men distributed themselves
in the place. Crouched closely together,
shoulders touching each other, they filled the
whole compartment like so many sardines in
a can.</p>

<p>"This is the air-lock chamber, boys,"
announced Superintendent Brown. "From
your submarine experience to date you can
easily understand the function of this chamber.
We have just stepped in here from the access
tube where there maintains the air pressure
of the surface. We want to go from here
into the <i>Nautilus</i>, where we can roll back
the open hatch from the bottom of the craft
and gaze upon the very sea itself held in
abeyance. How would you go about it, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Monaghan?" asked the superintendent, knowing
of Dick's predilection for mechanical
problems and his desire to pursue his education
through college.</p>

<p>Just for an instant Dick hesitated, and
then answered: "I should say you would
have to equalize the air pressure, sir."</p>

<p>"And you are right," answered the Bridgeford
official. "That is exactly what we have
to do here. It is out of the question to go
directly from the pressure of the surface to a
pressure of one hundred feet below the surface.
We simply come into this air chamber,
shut ourselves off completely from the world
above us, and then step ourselves up to the
required air pressure for one hundred feet."</p>

<p>So saying, the superintendent slammed shut
the door of the port through which the party
had entered the air-lock from the access tube,
and made it doubly secure with a stout pin
that slid into place behind a reinforcing bar.</p>

<p>"Now to let some more air into the
chamber."</p>

<p>Immediately an air-cock was opened and
with a hissing sound a great volume of compressed
air came into the little chamber so
tightly filled with humanity. Wsh-h-h-h-h!
it resounded through the narrow space like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the blow-off of a mighty steam exhaust. Just
for a few seconds, and then it was turned off.
Even though he had experienced divers aboard
who were accustomed to working in high
pressures below water, Superintendent Brown
was taking no chances. It was always best
to go slow, because with every foot of submergence
there is an increase of air pressure
upon every square inch of the body's surface
of no less than .43 of a pound.</p>

<p>At a depth of 100 feet under the sea the
total pressure would be approximately 45
additional pounds pressure against every
square inch of the body. With the average
human body representing a surface of about
2160 square inches, that meant that at a
depth of 100 feet a dead weight of more than
97,000 pounds would be pressing against the
body of each of them. Under such circumstances
the blood is forced away from the
surface of the body. The veins become thin,
while the deep-lying arteries are overworked.</p>

<p>It was a matter of but a short time until,
consulting the pressure gauge, the superintendent
found that he had admitted a sufficient
amount of compressed air to equalize the
difference between the surface and the one-hundred-foot
submarine level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now into the <i>Nautilus</i>!" As he said this,
"Montey" opened the huge port leading into
the diving chamber and stepped through.
He was closely followed by the remainder of
the party in single file, and presently they
had emerged in the compartment or working
chamber. Two or three men could work in
it comfortably; five filled it too completely.
There was just room for the quintet to stand
about easily without bumping each other.</p>

<p>Electric lights made the chamber as
light as a Broadway office building in the
evening. An electric fan buzzed in one corner
to keep the air on the move. A telephone
hung on the wall just to the left of Superintendent
Brown's head. Just at that moment
it tinkled merrily. The official took down the
receiver.</p>

<p>"Hello, hello. Yes, this is Brown. Yes,
we are all fine and dandy. Yep. We are
ready. Go ahead now."</p>

<p>The superintendent turned from the telephone.</p>

<p>"They are going to move us ahead slowly
in the water now. All hands stand by.
Maybe we may run into something."</p>

<p>Just then a slight jarring motion indicated
that the mother ship, the <i>Jules Verne</i>, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
gotten under way, and was steering the tiny
<i>Nautilus</i> ahead of her through the waters of
the Sound.</p>

<p>"Now you get the advantage of this system,
boys," the superintendent was saying.
"Here you are much safer and much more
comfortable than if you were out there on
the bottom floundering around in diving
armor. You can just stand here at ease,
breathing normally, with plenty of fresh
oxygen pouring down from above, and with
no unfavorable symptoms of any kind."</p>

<p>To impress this point, the superintendent
switched on an air-cock to emphasize the
point that the <i>Nautilus</i> was completely in
touch with the mother ship up at the other
end of the hundred-foot access tube.</p>

<p>"Look here, boys!" Captain Austin,
standing by one of the huge ports that dotted
the face of the <i>Nautilus</i> on either side of the
prow, beckoned them to look out. Through
the misty green of the water their eyes could
carry quite a distance with the aid of the
bright sunlight above. Certainly it was light
enough so that in the event of any lost ship
being encountered it could be seen in plenty
of time.</p>

<p>Through the floor of the <i>Nautilus</i> the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of the sea showed all around. The water
raced along under the glass of the aquascope
as the <i>Nautilus</i> was pushed steadily ahead.
Virtually the whole floor of the diving bell
was framed in a trap that could be raised and
lowered at will; and, from their own knowledge
of submarine affairs, the Brighton boys
knew that with the air pressure within the
<i>Nautilus</i> equal to that of the water itself at a
depth of one hundred feet, this flooring could
be rolled back, and still the water would not
come into the <i>Nautilus</i>!</p>

<p>"I know just what you are thinking about,"
laughed the superintendent, as he caught a
glimpse of Jay and Dick surveying the transparent
flooring of the <i>Nautilus</i>. "You are
thinking what a wonderful thing it is that
we can open the bottom of a craft submerged
one hundred feet down, and yet no water
pour in upon us. And it truly is a wonderful
thing. Just like the Lord opened the Red
Sea and enabled the children of Israel to get
across and outwit their pursuers."</p>

<p>Larry Seymour, to whom the experience
was all new, was losing no part of the proceedings.</p>

<p>"But what if your air pump went on the
bum about the time you opened up that
flooring?" he questioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the air pump failed, it would not affect
the water, but would cut off our breathing
supply," answered the official.</p>

<p>"How long could we last down here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, two or three of us working alone
could stand it for some hours without any
relief."</p>

<p>"Suppose some one opened the breech
caps leading out into the access tube while
the aquascope was up?"</p>

<p>"Wow-wow! In would come Mr. Ocean,
and I guess it would be all day for the chaps
who would be caught down here."</p>

<p>"Here you are, boys; see the whole panorama
of the sea bottom unfolded before you,"
remarked the superintendent as he directed
attention downward through the aquascope.
The lads looked in turn and saw the sea-bottom
plainly revealed, with all its sandy
bottom and its jagged contour of shells and
marine life. The floor of the <i>Nautilus</i> was,
in fact, so close to the bottom that it was
almost touching. Brown at once gave the
signal to the engine room of the mother ship
that stopped the <i>Nautilus</i>. With another
flip of the air pressure he raised the flooring
of the chamber and there lay the limpid
waters of the Sound, held in check completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
even at this depth by the pressure of air
within the chamber!</p>

<p>"By Jove! You just stopped in time,"
exclaimed Captain Austin as he turned from
one of the forward ports.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Captain?" asked
Superintendent Brown.</p>

<p>"Look here," replied "Cap," indicating the
port and motioning the fleet superintendent
to look out into the green haze of water.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XIV
<span class="ch">An Unexpected Find</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">CLOSING the aquascope of the <i>Nautilus</i>
with a quick turn of the air
control, Superintendent Brown stepped
lightly across the diving compartment of
the new salvage ship to the side of the fleet
captain.</p>

<p>"What's up, Cap?" he inquired casually.</p>

<p>Austin was peering intently straight ahead
through the water. The <i>Nautilus</i> was moving
slowly to and fro with the rise and fall of the
tide, but her progress forward through the
water had been checked by a signal to the
engine room of the mother ship, the <i>Jules
Verne</i>.</p>

<p>"Looks like we had accidentally run upon
a wreck our first day out." Captain Austin
had his gaze firmly directed upon the outlines
of some object near at hand, the character
of which he was not at all able to make
out as yet. Perhaps it was just a shifting
sand formation; or possibly an apparition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in the water due to the passage of the sun
behind clouds, or a school of fish in the bay.</p>

<p>Superintendent Brown took up his station
at another port just to the left of the captain.
His eyes by now, directed by Brown, rested
on the identical object that had first claimed
the attention of the captain.</p>

<p>"Blamed if I don't think you are right,
Austin," remarked the superintendent after
a bit.</p>

<p>He suggested that the <i>Nautilus</i> be moved
forward slightly in order that the two might
get a more comprehensive view of the "phantom
ship" that had loomed out of the mist
like some specter of the deep that Jules Verne
himself had conjured in "Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea."</p>

<p>Cap Austin fell in with the idea, and at
once took down the telephone connecting
with the <i>Jules Verne</i>.</p>

<p>"Move us forward until I give you one
bell and then stop right on the trigger," was
the order to the engine room of the mother
ship. Instantly the <i>Nautilus</i> was propelled
forward through the water. At the ports
stood the two officials straining their eyes
intently.</p>

<p>Jay and Dick stood conversing in low tones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
while Larry kept up his inspection of the
diving chamber. This was a new experience
for him and he was distinctly not at home.</p>

<p>"Looks like it is a small craft of some
kind ... might be a destroyer ... perhaps
a fishing boat ... no, it's bigger and of a
different design ... well heeled over to port
... close enough."</p>

<p>Fragments of the conversation between
Cap Austin and the yard superintendent
floated back to the ears of the Brighton boys.
They were as interested as their elders in
the proceedings. What an extraordinary
thing if on this first trip of the <i>Jules Verne</i>
and the <i>Nautilus</i> a lost ship should be found!</p>

<p>"Don't you think we had better stop now
and drift up a bit with the tide?" the superintendent
was asking.</p>

<p>Captain Austin thought it better to go
just a little closer. Ten or fifteen seconds
passed when he leaped forward suddenly
and rang the bell for the engines to be stopped
immediately. Quietly and with scarcely a
tremor the <i>Nautilus</i> glided to a standstill
in the deep. The locomotion of the craft
surely was perfect.</p>

<p>"Navy craft of some kind," ejaculated
the superintendent after a brief pause. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the interim he had been studying the
object now close at hand.</p>

<p>"I can see old battleship gray paint first
of all," he added.</p>

<p>A naval craft! For the moment Captain
Austin was nonplussed. Surely no one knew
Long Island Sound better than he; and he
had no recollection on the moment of any
naval craft having been sunk there for some
years. True, during the war, there had been
naval maneuvers of all kinds in the Sound,
particularly of the lighter draught vessels
stationed at various points from the Brooklyn
Navy Yard up to Rock Island, Maine.
But none&mdash;&mdash;And then it dawned on his mind:
A sub-chaser&mdash;the E-70. Sure enough, such
a craft had been accidentally rammed one
day by one of the new Lake submarines just
off the ways. Although valiant efforts had
been made to save the craft after she had
been rammed, all the work had been in vain.
Down she had gone in many fathoms of
water.</p>

<p>"I have it. It's the E-70 that went down
last August," exclaimed the captain as he
turned to the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Montey" listened while "Cap" Austin
unfolded the whole story of the disaster that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
had wiped a ship from the roster of the U. S.
Navy.</p>

<p>"Suppose we make sure of our identification
then, particularly since we have been so
fortunate as to run upon a derelict our very
first trip out," suggested the superintendent.</p>

<p>Captain Austin agreed that it would be the
ideal thing to thoroughly test out the <i>Jules
Verne</i> and the <i>Nautilus</i> with a minute inspection
of the find that fate had so coincidentally
thrown in their way.</p>

<p>Accordingly they jockeyed the <i>Nautilus</i>
to and fro through the water until they had
found the bow of the submarine chaser.
Jay and Dick had been reminded by their
captain to keep their eyes open and take in
every detail of the operation of the new diving
craft.</p>

<p>"It will be only a matter of a very few days
at the most until you chaps will be down
here as workmen instead of guests, and you
might as well get acquainted with the new
boat and learn everything about her you
can," the executive had told them.</p>

<p>Needless to say, they were more than
taking it all in; they were acclimating themselves
to the very best of their versatile
natures. It was marvelous how well the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
craft could be handled. The telephone
kept them constantly in touch with the
mother ship. In case they wanted to stop
or start suddenly, it was not necessary to
wait for the telephone. An electric buzzer
rung in accordance with a pre-arranged code
of signals told the engineer just what to do.</p>

<p>By now the aquascope, or windowed floor,
of the <i>Nautilus</i> was poised directly over the
bow of the lost sub-chaser. By moving the
chamber slightly to the left it was possible
to lower away toward the bottom until the
name of the lost craft might be noted from
the ports of the <i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<p>"Drop her down gradually now and I'll
keep a sharp lookout," said the superintendent,
at the same time directing Dick to take
his position at the other port and likewise
to pay all attention toward finding the telltale
mark of the supposed submarine chaser,
E-70, on the starboard side of the bow.</p>

<p>Jay remained by the side of Captain Austin.</p>

<p>"This is one thing you want to learn well
in advance and to keep constantly in mind,"
the ship's executive cautioned as he signaled
the <i>Jules Verne</i> to swing the <i>Nautilus</i> lower
in the water.</p>

<p>What the captain had in mind was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
equalizing of pressures. Every time the
<i>Nautilus</i> was lowered deeper in the water it
was necessary to take a greater air pressure
into the big diving chamber before the
aquascope could be raised. The depth always
showed on the depth-dial. Also the amount
of air in the chamber was registered by a
clock-like gauge. In a crevice on the steel
wall hung a small framed schedule under
glass showing the air pressure necessary to
suit varying depths. As yet the process
had not been made automatic. The engineer
had to keep this whole proposition constantly
in mind.</p>

<p>"See anything yet, Montey?" the captain
asked of the superintendent as the <i>Nautilus</i>
dropped slowly away into the depths.</p>

<p>Nothing by way of identification was yet
discernible, even though the superintendent
had turned on the powerful submarine searchlights
with which the <i>Nautilus</i> was equipped,
and, with the assistance of Jay, was sweeping
the sides of the derelict.</p>

<p>For several minutes they cast about in
the water, when of a sudden Jay exclaimed
eagerly:</p>

<p>"Hold right there."</p>

<p>Instantly Captain Austin checked the movement
of the diving outfit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"There! That looks like E-70 to me,"
exclaimed Jay. The superintendent moved
over beside him and as Jay withdrew from
his port station peered out through the
water.</p>

<p>With the glaring light of the <i>Nautilus'</i>
reflectors shining more dazzlingly at this close
range than any extraneous natural light that
filtered through from the sun, Superintendent
Brown beheld the crude yet only partially
obliterated legend: "E-70."</p>

<p>"Fine and dandy!" he shouted. "It's
proof positive. The craft out there is none
other than the lost U. S. submarine chaser
that was rammed last summer, as Captain
Austin has told us. A fine feather in the
cap of all of us. A find the first day out."</p>

<p>The superintendent's enthusiasm was contagious.
It spread to Larry Seymour like
wildfire.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the <i>Nautilus</i> and the
<i>Jules Verne</i>!" he cried in his excitement.</p>

<p>Deep down under the water, all unseen
by the world, these five submarine navigators
rejoiced over the success of their
venture. This, the first trip of the twin
diving craft, had so far proved eminently
satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys, we have here the positive proof
tangibly before our eyes," said Superintendent
Brown. "But suppose, in order to convince
our many friends upstairs on the deck of
the <i>Jules Verne</i>" (he pointed laughingly up
"The Subway" out of the <i>Nautilus</i>), "we
take something of the E-70 along with us
as a souvenir? What say?"</p>

<p>Everybody nodded assent.</p>

<p>"What will it be?" asked Captain Austin.</p>

<p>"Oh, say a smokestack or one of her boilers,"
snickered the superintendent, who had a
rare good sense of humor for all occasions.</p>

<p>"Suppose we take the whole blooming
sub-chaser with us," shot back Austin, not
to be outdone in the pleasantries.</p>

<p>They resolved to go fishing for a souvenir
of the E-70, and accordingly signaled the
<i>Jules Verne</i> to be lifted in the water. So
soon as the <i>Nautilus</i> had been raised level
with the sloping deck of the submarine
chaser he flashed again for a stop and then
buzzed for a slow movement ahead. Unerringly
the tiny diving chamber was pushed
forward directly over the forward deck of
the E-70. Through the aquascope at their
feet the five men in the <i>Nautilus</i> could see
the outlines of the lost craft silhouetted
against the background of the sea bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now to go down slowly," mused the ship's
captain. Gracefully as in an elevator in
the Woolworth Tower the <i>Nautilus</i> was
eased down until it was poised directly over
the forward deck of the E-70 to starboard.</p>

<p>"See anything you can get a hold of?"
asked Captain Austin as he brought the
<i>Nautilus</i> to a stop not more than five or ten
feet from the submarine chaser.</p>

<p>Everybody in the party, including the
superintendent, was down on his knees peering
through the aquascope.</p>

<p>"Sure as a cat has kittens!" yelled Larry
Seymour. "Slip me a knockout if I don't
see one of that old busted bird's binnacle
lamps still hanging there. See it!" He was
pointing now and directing the others where
to look.</p>

<p>Soon they saw it. And no sooner was it
spied than every last one of them resolved
they would stay down here now until they
had their souvenir. Forthwith Captain Austin
signaled the <i>Jules Verne</i> again to be lowered.
Three feet was all he wanted.</p>

<p>And then the miracle again. One hundred
feet down in the embrace of the ocean,
bottled up in a diving chamber that stood
directly over a shipwreck, suffering not,
even though working in a high-pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
atmosphere, these five men saw the floor
beneath them rolled away again and the water
of the deep sea held completely in check,&mdash;an
unseen hand of compressed air hurling
it back as King Canute would have swept the
ocean back from the strand!</p>

<p>"Get it, Seymour," said Superintendent
Brown, pointing to the binnacle lamp of
the E-70. For there it was directly beneath
the open aquascope of the <i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<p>And the debonair young Mr. Seymour,
now quite at ease in the diving chamber
that had been both a riddle and a nightmare
to him when he came below for the first
time, nonchalantly sat down on the floor of
the <i>Nautilus</i> and thrust his legs out into
the sea. With no more effort than though
he were hauling out a huge sea carp, he
leaned down and tore from its rusted fastenings
the binnacle lamp of the E-70. Willing
hands reached to assist him lift it into the
<i>Nautilus</i>; but Larry was more than equal
to the occasion.</p>

<p>"There it is&mdash;E-70," exclaimed Superintendent
Brown, pointing to lettering on
the side of the lamp, still visible through rust.</p>

<p>"And some souvenir to take to our friends
on the <i>Jules Verne</i>," replied "Cap" Austin as
the party made ready to vacate the <i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XV
<span class="ch">Trapped in the Diving Bell</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">JAY Thacker and Dick Monaghan,
together with their friend Larry Seymour,
took to the new diving ship of
the Bridgeford Salvage Company like the
proverbial ducks to water. Starting with
their first trip the day they reclaimed a
binnacle lamp from the deck of the lost
submarine chaser E-70, they showed a ready
aptitude for the work at hand and soon
proved themselves adepts.</p>

<p>News of the <i>Jules Verne's</i> accomplishments
had been flashed to all corners of the
world and maritime engineers were much
interested. Many of them came to inquire
into her merits and were well pleased after
an inspection of the twin craft.</p>

<p>Usually Jay and Dick worked together in
the diving chamber. At times they had little
to do except to keep an eye upon things generally.
Upon these occasions they had ample
opportunity to discuss their own personal
affairs, and so naturally fell into talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the new college year. Both were anxious to
make the 'varsity football team for one thing
and they were wondering how many of the
old boys would be back and what the chances
would be for turning out a championship
team. The gridiron sport was their favorite.</p>

<p>"Wonder if Bob Greer and Chick Wharton
will be back?" speculated Jay, recalling that
it was a great game the pair had won through
their individual efforts in the last game they
had played for Brighton just before enlisting
for the war.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I hope Jack Hammond and Ted
Wainwright are on hand, too," replied Dick,
recalling two of his best chums who had
enlisted early in the Navy and gotten into
the submarine service.</p>

<p>One day in early August the boys had gone
down in the <i>Nautilus</i> to place a bomb under
the deck of a coal barge that had been located
that morning. More than two thousand
tons of coal were to be reclaimed and the
boys realized they would come in for a good
premium on the job, which meant a lot to
them, in view of their anxiety to get together
as much of a pile as possible before college
opened in the fall.</p>

<p>Larry Seymour as usual was in charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the big centrifugal pump&mdash;the "All Day
Sucker," as the crew had termed the old
pump with which coal cargoes were raised.</p>

<p>Everything was working fine. Without
a hitch the <i>Nautilus</i> was dropped in the
Sound by the <i>Jules Verne</i> until the access
tube lay like the hypotenuse of a huge right-angled
triangle that had the <i>Jules Verne</i>
for its upper apex and the bottom of the sea
for its base.</p>

<p>Casting about over the deck of the barge,
Jay, who was really the executive officer of
the diving chamber with Dick as his assistant,
found a suitable spot for a base of operations.
Quickly the aquascope of the <i>Nautilus</i> was
rolled back and the waters of the Sound
lapped at the edges of the trap door.</p>

<p>It was necessary only to make an opening
large enough to insert the time bomb that
Jay had brought down from the <i>Jules Verne</i>.
This was but the matter of a few seconds'
work. While Jay worked at the opening
Dick arranged the mechanism of the time
clock. His knowledge of and his predilection
for mechanics made him an expert at
this kind of business.</p>

<p>"She's all ready," he told Jay in a few
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I'm all ready for you, too, chum,"
came the reply.</p>

<p>Together they lowered away with their
legs through the aquascope until they stood
on the deck of the barge. They were in
water up to their knees, while the rest of
their bodies were safe and dry within the
enclosure of the <i>Nautilus</i>. Carefully the
bomb was inserted and so held that it would
be most likely to rip open a good-sized hole
in the deck when it exploded.</p>

<p>"Let's go, chum," counseled Jay as they
completed this final phase of their immediate
task. So saying they crawled back into
the <i>Nautilus</i> and while Dick attended closing
and making fast again the aquascope,
Jay turned to the telephone to tell Larry
they were ready to be raised again.</p>

<p>"You set that bomb to go off soon, didn't
you?" called Jay to his chum, as he took
down the telephone receiver.</p>

<p>"Yep, in seventeen minutes&mdash;just at one-thirty
sharp," answered Dick.</p>

<p>To which Jay nodded in approval and then
turned to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Raise away, Larry; we're all set down
here and anxious to get out of the way."</p>

<p>In the small chamber of the <i>Nautilus</i> both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
boys could hear the voice at the other end
of the wire when the one holding the receiver
kept it slightly removed from his ear.</p>

<p>"Will take you up in two minutes," came
the reply from Larry on the deck of the
<i>Jules Verne</i>.</p>

<p>The two minutes went by, but so far as
the boys could tell the <i>Nautilus</i> was not in
motion. The depth dial still showed a
submergence of eighty feet, the distance to
the deck of the coal barge.</p>

<p>"Must have forgotten us," mused Jay as
he stepped again to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Your two minutes are up and we are
still waiting, Larry; better hurry it up."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then came the
voice of Larry from the other end:</p>

<p>"Cap wants to know whether you have
set your time bomb and when it is to go off."</p>

<p>"All set to go off at half-past one&mdash;in just
a quarter of an hour," was Jay's rejoinder.</p>

<p>Jay turned from the telephone with the
statement to his chum that the air pump of
the <i>Jules Verne</i> was working none too well
and that the chief engineer, with Cap Austin,
was trying to find out what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Well, all I've got to say is they better
get it working before very long or you and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
are in danger of being blown up when that
bomb goes off in the coal barge directly
underneath us," suggested Dick. He was
not exactly an alarmist; but the situation
had possibilities that did not appear at all
inviting.</p>

<p>"You forget there is another way for us
to be raised," was Jay's come-back.</p>

<p>Dick had forgotten for the moment.</p>

<p>"You forget that when the air pump fails
the <i>Nautilus</i> is raised by steel cables. Deckmen
wind us up with those huge winches
that stand well forward on the <i>Jules Verne</i>
near the hatchway leading to the access
tube."</p>

<p>"Sure enough!" exclaimed Dick. This
secondary method had quite escaped his
memory for the present. Reassured, the
boys put fear out of their minds and awaited
developments.</p>

<p>Five minutes sped by, and still nothing
happened. Going to the telephone Jay
asked again how they were getting along
above.</p>

<p>"Gee, pal, I'm sorry, but they don't seem
to be making much headway as yet," came
Larry's reply.</p>

<p>As Jay listened he could tell that Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Austin was talking to Larry. He could
hear him mention the word "bomb."</p>

<p>"Cap says it don't look like as though we
could get the pump going in a hurry, so he
is going to take no chances and will haul
you up with the cables," sang out Larry in
return.</p>

<p>"All right, let 'er go, for the love of Mike!"
yelled Jay.</p>

<p>Time was indeed getting short. In ten
minutes more the bomb in the coal barge
would go off. There was nothing else to do.
Either the <i>Nautilus</i> had to be raised at once
or the time bomb in the coal barge had to be
disengaged to avert what might prove to
be a disaster for the two Brighton boys.
Since the air pump was out of commission
it was impossible for the boys to go out
through the air-lock into the access tube.
There was no way to swing back the heavy
doors with the compressed air cut off.</p>

<p>Neither could the ballast tanks under the
<i>Nautilus</i> and the access tube be blown out
so long as the air pump on the <i>Jules Verne</i>
was out of commission.</p>

<p>In this extremity the cables were the
only means of lifting the <i>Nautilus</i> out of the
depths. The men must be working now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
for it was some job to wind the winches by
hand, and progress through the water would
be so much slower than if the diving chamber
were "trimmed" in the regular way.</p>

<p>Jay and Dick were not cowards. They
had proved that a number of times in school
and while they served in the Navy abroad
during the war. Each youth had proved
his gameness on more than one occasion.
So in the present extremity they were far
from flabbergasted at the failure of the air
apparatus on the mother ship just after
they had placed a time bomb in the coal
barge. Cool and collected they awaited
developments. Each was a quick-witted
lad and could be counted on to make the best
of any situation.</p>

<p>Finally the telephone bell rang. Jay
wrenched off the receiver. Larry was talking
like a phonograph in high gear.</p>

<p>"Bad news, fellows. Just as they were
winding for the first heavy pull on the cables
the right main cable on the under side of
the access tube snapped clean in two. The
whole system of cables is put out of business.
Cap says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this juncture Captain Austin leaped
forward and took up the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much time have you got until your
bomb goes off, boys?" he called down the
tube, quietly and without any show of
apprehension.</p>

<p>Jay eyed his watch for a second.</p>

<p>"Not more than five minutes," came Jay's
even reply.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing to do," the Captain
told him in reassuring tones. "Our pump
has gone back on us and the steel cables
have parted on us&mdash;a combination of hard
luck that would not happen once in a thousand
years. Can you get your bomb back in
any way and detach it?"</p>

<p>Jay said they would try, and turned toward
his chum. "It's our only chance now,
Dick," he told him.</p>

<p>Together they flung back the aquascope
to grapple for the bomb they had set under
the deck of the coal barge. But to their
horror and dismay they found that the tide
had swung the <i>Nautilus</i> slightly away from
the opening in the barge&mdash;at least three or
four feet!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XVI
<span class="ch">An Explosion Impends</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE was now no chance to avert the
explosion of the time bomb within the
coal barge. On the appointed time it
would go off as arranged and unless the
mechanism by some freak of luck refused to
work; but the chances on this score were few
indeed. The mechanism represented the very
latest scientific thought and the bomb was
essentially for submarine work of this
character.</p>

<p>"Looks, chum, as though we were in for
the fireworks," smiled Dick, who was as
cool as though he were standing on the
twenty-five yard line at Brighton waiting
for the ball to be passed for a try at a goal
from the field.</p>

<p>Jay had not yet given up hope of getting
the <i>Nautilus</i> moving, or of escaping from her
in some way. He looked at his watch.
Little more than a minute until the bomb
would go off!</p>

<p>"Why in the name of sense don't they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
start the engines of the <i>Jules Verne</i> and back
her away from the barge?" he ejaculated
in consternation. By moving the <i>Jules
Verne</i> the <i>Nautilus</i> also would be moved.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear Larry say there was
a breakdown in the engine room of the <i>Jules
Verne</i> that was the cause of the whole
trouble?" put back Dick, who was by far
the more self-possessed of the two.</p>

<p>Slowly Jay shook his head in affirmation.
Memory had fled with the rapid flow of
events of the last quarter of an hour. Was it
any wonder his senses reeled? Two youths
completely trapped in a diving chamber
that was poised directly over a coal barge
in which a high explosive time bomb was
set to go off now at any time!</p>

<p>There was a chance, of course, that the
detonation might not be severe enough to
damage the <i>Nautilus</i>. The bomb might
explode outward or downward instead of
spending its energy upward under the keel
of the diving bell. In that event the shock
might not be sufficient to rend the seams of
the light steel chamber in which the Brighton
boys were crouched awaiting the inevitable
crash. If&mdash;but no one could tell under
circumstances like these just what would
happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we could only get into the air-lock
we would be farther away from the explosion
and less likely of being bashed up," said
Jay as he looked toward the exit chamber.</p>

<p>"Yes, and if we could get into the air-lock
we could get out into the access tube,"
added Dick.</p>

<p>Steadily they gazed into each other's eyes.
Jay held his own watch in his hand, while
Dick at intervals looked at the tiny steel
clock behind a wire socket on the side of
the <i>Nautilus</i>. By the rays of an incandescent
bulb Dick could see that the minute hand
had just turned twenty-seven minutes after
one o'clock.</p>

<p>Tick by tick the clock was measuring off
the few seconds that remained until the time
bomb in the coal bunker underneath was
scheduled to go off. Like two men sentenced
to die before an enemy firing squad the
Brighton lads stood facing each other in
the diving compartment. Just the trace
of a smile showed over their faces. They
clenched hands in a firm grasp.</p>

<p>"In half a minute more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The jingling of the telephone bell jarred
the stiff silence and stirred the boys from
their stupor. As though hypnotized, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
had stood awaiting the finish, not thinking
of any further movement calculated to free
them from their predicament. They had
figured everything that could be done for
their rescue having been thought of, or
tried out.</p>

<p>But now the jangle of the telephone receiver,
Jay moved to take it off the hook and as he
did so his right foot struck the pin that held
the aquascope in position. When the pin
was removed the trapdoor, or aquascope as
they called it, opened upward of its own
accord on an air-cushion that worked on the
principle of a door cushion.</p>

<p>And that was what happened at this
particular moment in the <i>Nautilus</i>. The
aquascope opened upward, leaving the limpid
waters of the Sound purling at the very feet
of the two boys. Just for a second the
boys recoiled in horror, thinking now they
were in greater danger. With the door
open there was more chance of the force of
the explosion below being felt within the
<i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<p>Dick sprang to close the aquascope in the
few seconds that remained until the explosion.
But imagine his surprise when Jay
intercepted and hurled him away from the
trap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quick, chum, follow me," cried Jay in
wild acclaim.</p>

<p>The opening of the aquascope had given
the youth an inspiration. Yes, he would
do it. It was a last desperate chance, but
there was no reason why it would not work
if carried out in time.</p>

<p>Even as Dick started back in consternation
when thrust from the aquascope Jay
literally leaped feet first into the aquascope
as though he were jumping into a miniature
swimming pool. Down he went until his
feet struck at last on the deck of the coal
barge. In this position he stood in water
up to his chest, with his head and shoulders
still in the <i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" gasped
Dick. He had failed yet to grasp the significance
of his chum's quick move.</p>

<p>"Dive out of here and take my chances
on shooting up to the surface," came the
instantaneous reply.</p>

<p>Then it dawned on Dick. What his
chum intended doing was to let himself out
of the <i>Nautilus</i> through the trap door, dive
free of the salvage chamber and shoot up
to the surface. And why not? They were
down about eighty-five feet, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
accustomed to the pressure of that depth
since the pressure in the <i>Nautilus</i> had had
to be equal that of the water outside in
order to open the trap safely. A sickly grin
spread across the Brighton youth's face.
Why hadn't either he or Jay thought of
that before?</p>

<p>"Come on, Dick, follow me," urged Jay,
and almost before the words escaped his
lips he quickly took a full inhalation into
his lungs, gave one last look at his chum
and ducked down head first into the waters
of Long Island Sound through the open
trap of the <i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<p>Like some weird specter in a motion picture
drama Dick beheld the spectacle at his feet.
First he saw Jay's head under the water;
then he saw his chum flatten out under the
bottom of the <i>Nautilus</i>, and as he looked
again he could faintly make out Jay's feet
as they faded away from the darker expanse
of the barge deck below. Jay had cleared
the <i>Nautilus</i> safely.</p>

<p>"Here goes, too," gasped Dick to himself
as he leaped through the aquascope. Almost
instinctively as he let go, his eyes lifted to
the tiny marine clock in its basket-like
cage. Right on the half hour mark showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the minute hand. With a last frantic gasp
for breath Dick pulled himself down into
the embrace of water. Down out of the
<i>Nautilus</i> into the embrace of water and into
such close proximity with that infernal coal
bomb!</p>

<p>"If I can only hurl myself&mdash;quickly&mdash;to&mdash;one&mdash;side&mdash;before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then the bomb exploded with a frightful
force that rent the waters of the Sound
in that particular locality with the force of
an earthquake. In the midst of this maelstrom
were the two Brighton youths who had
taken a last desperate chance when it seemed
they were doomed to die like rats in a trap.</p>

<p>What&mdash;Where&mdash;&mdash;!!!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Up on the deck of the <i>Jules Verne</i> there
was the maddest confusion. It had maintained
for nearly half an hour, since the
chief engineer had first reported trouble
from below. Frantically, members of the
crew were endeavoring to make the necessary
repairs. In the meantime, every one
knew by now of the perilous position of the
two Brighton boys who had been working
for some time in the <i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<p>"My God, man, we've got to get those boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
up somehow!" raved Superintendent Brown
as he paced the deck.</p>

<p>Captain Austin, his face tense with anxiety,
was directing the knot of men who were
endeavoring to string up again a set of
cables that ran down along the access tube
and connected under the <i>Nautilus</i>. Fortunately,
the captain had seen the break
coming just before the steel parted and the
severed ends had been held before they had
dropped overboard.</p>

<p>Watch in hand, Captain Austin was keeping
tabs on the time limit until the bomb in
the coal barge was scheduled to go off. Eagerly
the captain had scanned the bay in every
direction for some other vessel that might
stand by and give them help. But not a
craft showed anywhere close, not even a
sailboat. Unfortunately, the <i>Jules Verne</i>
had not as yet been fitted out with wireless,
and there was, consequently, no way to
communicate ashore or with any other vessel.</p>

<p>"How are you coming, boys, on those
cables?" Superintendent "Montey" Brown
kept inquiring every minute or so of the
repair crew.</p>

<p>They were making progress, but it was
slow work. Splicing was no easy task,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
especially with steel wire. If brand new cables
could be run out it would be a much easier
proposition; but that was out of the question
with the <i>Nautilus</i> on the bottom of the
Sound over the coal barge eighty-five feet
under water. And there were no diving
suits as yet on the <i>Jules Verne</i> for just such
emergency cases as these.</p>

<p>"Tell them to keep a stout heart," Captain
Austin reminded Larry Seymour several times,
who was at the telephone and signal booth
connecting with the <i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<p>Larry in turn reported that he could not
always get a reply from below.</p>

<p>"Probably they are trying some way to
worm their way out," suggested Larry, who
was nearly beside himself with worry for
his two old pals. Poor old Jay and Dick!
They had been such good friends for so long.
Was it possible now that some disaster was
to overtake them?</p>

<p>It was while Larry was thus painfully
reviewing the possibilities of the next few
minutes that Captain Austin suggested to
the boys in the <i>Nautilus</i> that they try and
put the time bomb in the coal barge out of
commission. Eagerly the would-be rescuers
on the <i>Jules Verne</i> awaited developments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"It can't be done now, for we have moved
away from the opening in the deck of the
barge a yard or so," had been the answer
sent up by Jay after the two imprisoned
Brighton youths had inspected the barge
through the aquascope of the <i>Nautilus</i>.</p>

<p>Well, the only chance hope of rescue now,
it seemed, depended on getting the cables
spliced and the winches winding before the
bomb was detonated. Like beavers the
deckmen of the <i>Jules Verne</i> were exerting
themselves. It was a fight for two lives,
and the men of the <i>Jules Verne</i> were spending
themselves to the limit.</p>

<p>"How much time remains?" asked Superintendent
Brown after what seemed an eternity
of tugging with the torn cables.</p>

<p>In turn he was told that less than five
minutes remained. By the clock in the
chart house of the <i>Jules Verne</i> it was just
twenty-six minutes after one. And Jay had
sent up word that the bomb was set for one-thirty!</p>

<p>As a last resort Captain Austin called for
volunteers and asked that they dive from the
deck of the <i>Jules Verne</i> as the bomb was
exploded in the coal barge and see whether
they could find any trace of the two Brighton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
boys in the water, or learn whether or not
the <i>Nautilus</i> had been ripped open wide by
the force of the explosion. A half dozen
stepped forward, and the captain asked
them all to be ready.</p>

<p>"Stand by the telephone and try to get
them so soon as the explosion goes off, for
they may not be hurt at all," were Larry's
orders. With receiver glued to his right ear
he sat awaiting the crash.</p>

<p>Just then the foreman in charge of the
cable repairs reported that he could commence
to wind in another half minute.</p>

<p>"Tell Thacker and Monaghan we are going
to raise them now by the cables and to keep
a stiff upper lip down there," commanded
Austin.</p>

<p>Larry buzzed and buzzed, but in vain.
No answer came from the interior of the
<i>Nautilus</i>. What had happened? Larry was
frantic as he pushed down hard and harder
on the button.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried one of the crew forward
as he pointed off the starboard bow of the
<i>Jules Verne</i> at an object that had just shot
up out of the water. It was the head of a
man!</p>

<p>As members of the crew of the <i>Jules Verne</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
with Superintendent Brown and Captain
Austin in the lead, swarmed to the side of
the ship there came an upheaval from
beneath and a tremor that shook the old
boat from stem to stern. It was as though
a geyser had let loose directly under the
new diving ship.</p>

<p>"The bomb! It has exploded!" Larry
Seymour, his face ashen white, sought anew
to get a telephone communication with the
two Brighton boys whom he loved so dearly.</p>

<p>But even as he despaired there came a
welcome cry forward.</p>

<p>"Thacker! It's Thacker! He escaped
unharmed from the <i>Nautilus</i>."</p>

<p>But where was Dick?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XVII
<span class="ch">A Dog to the Rescue</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">EVEN as the crowd of sailors on the <i>Jules
Verne</i> cheered, Jay Thacker turned
on his back in the waters of Long Island
Sound and waved a hearty salute to his
friends. Unharmed, he had completely
escaped from the <i>Nautilus</i> just a few seconds
before the bomb was exploded in the sunken
coal barge.</p>

<p>"Jay! Jay! Keep afloat&mdash;we'll have you
in a minute," yelled Larry Seymour as he
crowded to the rail, tears of joy streaming
down his face.</p>

<p>"Catch the rope!" Jay heard the cry
from the deck of the <i>Jules Verne</i>. Turning
he beheld a group of sailors and from their
midst one who was ready to cast a line. But
even before the line was hurled the figure of
another lithe youth poised for a second on
the rail and then dived into the water.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Seymour!" came the re-echoing
shout. And in the next moment Jay saw
the round and puffing face of Larry directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
beside him. It was Larry who had dived
overboard to the rescue. With a few strokes
he was close up and thrust a sturdy shoulder
under Jay's shoulders. Jay had turned on
his back to rest for a moment.</p>

<p>"Thank God, boy, you got out!" gasped
Larry. "Are you hurt? Can you swim?"</p>

<p>Jay replied he was still able to take care of
himself.</p>

<p>"Better look for Dick; he must be somewhere
around here," was Jay's rejoinder.</p>

<p>But taking no chances, Larry supported
his old friend until the line had come over the
side of the <i>Jules Verne</i>. When Jay had taken
hold and was being yanked aboard Larry
turned and swam back in the general direction
whence Jay had come, hoping against hope
that he would be able to find some trace of
Dick. But he was nowhere in sight!</p>

<p>As for Jay, he was given a wonderful
welcome when at last he was hauled over the
side of the <i>Jules Verne</i>. Eager hands clasped
him and landed him in safety at last upon
the deck of the vessel.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, lad, you are safe again&mdash;I
had almost given up hope of ever seeing you
again!" exclaimed Captain Austin as he
clasped Jay with a fatherly hug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor I either," said "Montey" Brown
as he, with others who had come out on the
trip of the <i>Jules Verne</i> and <i>Nautilus</i>, crowded
around.</p>

<p>But Jay was thinking of something else.
Dick! Where was his chum, Dick Monaghan?
What had happened to him?</p>

<p>"We've got to find him somehow; I am
sure that he followed me out of the <i>Nautilus</i>.
He said he would follow suit as I prepared
to lower away through the aquascope."</p>

<p>Under orders of Captain Austin a small
dory was being lowered aft, manned by a
trio of sailors who had orders to patrol the
waters just forward of the <i>Jules Verne</i> over
the spot where the <i>Nautilus</i> had been
submerged.</p>

<p>"Let me go along; I've got to find my
chum," wailed Jay as he saw the boat going
over the side. But friendly hands restrained
him. He was in no condition for further
effort after his hazardous exploit.</p>

<p>Just then there came a cry from the bridge
of the <i>Jules Verne</i>, where a number of visitors
had taken their station earlier in the day to
watch the demonstration of the new diving
craft.</p>

<p>"Look! What's that object floating in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
water off the port bow? Not more than three
or four points off and about fifty feet ahead."</p>

<p>A gentleman in panama hat and palm beach
suit, a representative of a maritime magazine,
who had come aboard as a guest of Superintendent
Brown, was pointing out over the
water.</p>

<p>Immediately all attention was directed that
way. Jay had come up out of the depths on
the starboard bow of the <i>Jules Verne</i>; so, of
one accord, passengers and crew of the vessel
surged to the port rail and scanned the waters
of the Sound. Jay was one of the first
across the deck.</p>

<p>"Where is it? What is it?" he called out
excitedly.</p>

<p>The journalist pointed. Every eye followed
the general direction indicated by the
pointing finger.</p>

<p>"Some object floating in the water. Can't
see what it is from here," added the lookout.
Several others standing by his side agreed
there was something out there in the water.</p>

<p>"It's Dick! It's Dick, my chum!" Jay was
in a frenzy and would have leaped overboard
to go to the rescue had he not been restrained.
Captain Austin by this time had run aft and
with megaphone in hand directed the sailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
in the dory to row around the stern of the
<i>Jules Verne</i> and come up on the port bow
of the vessel.</p>

<p>In all this confusion, amid all the babel
of voices, there resounded the furious barking
of a dog. Fismes, an eye-witness of the
rescue of Jay, had become all excited, too,
and was giving vent to himself with raucous
barking. With canine instinct the animal
seemed to sense the situation. And when
everyone began pointing in a certain direction
over the side, the dog concluded there was
something out there demanding attention;
something to be retrieved from the water.</p>

<p>It required no word of instruction, no
exhortation, to tell this dog what to do.
Gathering himself with all his strength, the
lean hound leaped from the deck of the
<i>Jules Verne</i> directly into the water. No one
told him to go; none had an opportunity
to hold him in check.</p>

<p>"Fismes! Fismes! Good old dog! Go to
it!" screamed Jay in sheer delight.</p>

<p>Almost breathlessly the crowd on the
ship watched the dog. As though guided
by some uncanny power the dog swam straight
and true in the direction of the floating
object. Was it the body of a man? Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
it the form of Dick Monaghan? The dog
knew not; he sensed only the fact that
something was floating out there in the water,
and it was something that all eyes on board
were watching.</p>

<p>"Good dog, Fismes!" they were shouting.</p>

<p>On and on the faithful canine swam with
all the strength of his slim legs. And soon
he had reached the side of this mysterious
object and set his teeth in it. They who were
shouting encouragement from the <i>Jules Verne</i>
saw all this and marveled at the strength of
the animal. They saw him take a firm hold.
They saw him stop for an instant. They
saw him start to swim again, this time toward
the ship&mdash;and towing the object along through
the water as best he could! Only a dog&mdash;but
what a wonderful animal! Swimming
superbly and maintaining a vise-like grip
on the salvaged object.</p>

<p>A mighty shout arose from the deck of
the <i>Jules Verne</i>.</p>

<p>"It's Monaghan," came the cry from Superintendent
Brown, who had rushed into the
wheel-house for a pair of glasses that he
might get a closer view of the magnet that
had lured the dog into the water.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! it's Dick! Hurrah for Fismes!"
screamed Jay in a perfect delirium of joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>And Dick it was. By this time the rescue
boat had arrived alongside and dragged both
the inert form of Dick and the wet, tousled
dog into the dory. One of the sailors was
tugging at the blouse of the rescued diver
and feeling for the heart pulse. The other
two pulled with all their might for the <i>Jules
Verne</i>.</p>

<p>"He's still alive," the sailor shouted as
the dory came alongside.</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" cried Jay as he bent
over the rail of the <i>Jules Verne</i> looking down
into the face of his chum. The eyes were
closed and the body crumpled in an inert
mass. But life still remained, and surely the
spark that remained could be fanned again
into a flame!</p>

<p>Tenderly they took the unconscious
Brighton youth aboard. Expert hands began
working over him immediately. First the
water was drained out of the throat and
lungs. Then next the pulmotor was brought
into action. Every device known in the
resuscitation of the drowned was applied
under the direction of Captain Austin.</p>

<p>And in the meantime a lean brown German
police dog answering to the name of Fismes
was being patted and fêted by an admiring
throng!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by they who ministered to the
unconscious diver were rewarded by a flicker
of the eyes and a stirring of the pulses that
bespoke the return of life. The pulmotor
with its stores of precious oxygen was getting
in its effective work. And none watched
more solicitously than Jay Thacker as he
knelt close beside his old Brighton chum.</p>

<p>"Dick! Dick! Open your eyes. Speak
to me," pleaded Jay.</p>

<p>And presently the eyes opened. Just for
an instant and then closed again. Slowly
but surely respiration became normal again.
The splendid physique of the boy who had
always taken good care of himself and lived
a normal outdoor life was standing him good
in the pinch. Where a weakling would have
succumbed to such an ordeal the athletic
Brighton student who had served his country
so faithfully and efficiently in the Navy was
pulling through.</p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity to Jay
consciousness came back at last to his chum.
Opening his eyes Dick gazed first into the
face of his old "bunkie."</p>

<p>"It's you, Jay," he mumbled feebly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick, old boy, it's Jay," sobbed the
latter. The strain had told on Jay. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
about ready to collapse but held himself
together by sheer grit. And now he was
rewarded, for Dick had been saved. Jay
could only throw his arms around Fismes and
hug the dog in his delight.</p>

<p>Jay told them all and in turn asked what
had happened on the mother ship that had
put the air pumps and the engines out of
commission. Engineers were still working
on repairs, and by now had succeeded in
getting the engines working again. But
it was some time before the air pumps were
working.</p>

<p>In the meantime Dick responded wonderfully
to treatment. For a time he was
completely bewildered, knowing not what
had happened to him, where he was and how
he had been brought back again safe on the
<i>Jules Verne</i>. But slowly it all came back to
him and he was able to tell what had happened
to him.</p>

<p>It developed that just as he had lowered
away through the trap of the <i>Nautilus</i> to
follow Jay in a desperate effort to escape to
the surface from the depths the bomb in
the coal barge had exploded. Just as he had
dipped his head into the water it had gone
off. Caught off balance in an awkward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
position before he had had a chance to dive
from the deck of the barge, he had been flung
against the steel side of the <i>Nautilus</i>. He
had felt the impact, and then he knew nothing
more, for the blow had rendered him unconscious.</p>

<p>And then, in turn, Dick heard the story of
how his body had been discovered floating
in the water, and how Fismes had dived
overboard to the rescue, and held his friend
safely until a rescue boat picked them both
up. Dick's eyes gleamed as he heard of the
splendid part played in the rescue by the
war dog.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked the Brighton boy.</p>

<p>Jay sprang up on deck and came back
presently with Fismes, fairly carrying him
all the way.</p>

<p>"Here he is," he cried, as he appeared
again in Dick's bunk room with the dog.</p>

<p>Old Fismes, wagging his tail and laying his
silken ears back by way of recognition,
stalked sheepishly across the room and licked
the outstretched hand of the youth on the
cot.</p>

<p>"I owe my life to you, and I'll guard your
life as long as life is spared to me," said Dick
as he pulled the nose of the dog over on the
counterpane and stroked the still wet head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Back to Brighton he goes with us; and
he'll be the best mascot the academy ever
had," added Jay emphatically.</p>

<p>Dick nodded approval with a smile and
sank back on his pillow to rest again, weak
from the exertion.</p>

<p>In another hour the repairs had been completed
and the <i>Jules Verne</i> was able to move
again under her own power. The <i>Nautilus</i>
had been raised, but so far there had been
no opportunity to determine whether the
diving chamber had been damaged.</p>

<p>"But that is small concern, indeed, when
we consider the fact that these two brave
young divers are safe and sound again after
a terrible experience," exclaimed Superintendent
Brown as he directed Captain Austin
to start back again to Bridgeford.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XVIII
<span class="ch">Honors for Heroes</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was the sixteenth day of August. Only
a month remained until Brighton Academy
was scheduled to begin another
school year. And what a year it promised
to be! Many lads who had dropped out of
school at the beginning of the World War
were expected to return again to the familiar
dormitories to renew old friendships and to
continue the interrupted courses of study that
would fit them either for college entrance or
for active careers of usefulness in the world of
work.</p>

<p>None looked forward more eagerly to the
commencement of this new school year than
Jay Thacker and Richard Monaghan, the
two lads who had been spending the summer
vacation, following their discharge from service
in the spring, with the Bridgeford Salvage
Company in the reclamation of lost treasure
and in testing out new apparatus lately
devised by shipyard officials, together with
noted scientists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten days' rest had served to restore the
boys completely to good health again after
their harrowing experience in the <i>Nautilus</i>
when they had been trapped at the bottom
of Long Island Sound. Jay had come through
entirely unaffected by his experience. As for
Dick, he had felt the effects of his experience
more severely. The bump that he had received
when hurled against the side of the
<i>Nautilus</i> by the explosion of the time bomb in
the sunken coal barge had bruised him up
somewhat, although no bones were broken.
The nervous strain, together with the prolonged
stay under heavy pressure, had left
their marks. For a few days he had remained
dazed; but in the end his iron constitution had
triumphed. Expert medical attention, combined
with complete rest, had brought him
around in fine shape again.</p>

<p>One morning just a week after the affair in
the Sound the boys were summoned to the
office of Superintendent Brown.</p>

<p>"Bring Fismes along with you," was the
additional summons.</p>

<p>Arriving half an hour later at the headquarters
of the shipbuilding officials, the
Brighton boys were surprised to find all the
officials of the company assembled, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with other distinguished looking persons,
none of whom they recognized.</p>

<p>"Come right in, and bring that dandy dog
in with you," the superintendent called when
the boys' arrival was announced.</p>

<p>In walked the trio, the war dog falling into
dignified step between his two masters. Eager
eyes turned to catch a glimpse of the illustrious
dog and his even more illustrious
sponsors. At this juncture, Mr. John R.
Walter, the president of the Bridgeford Company,
stepped forward and greeted the
Brighton boys. Jay and Dick had heard his
name, of course; but not until now had they
had the privilege of knowing him.</p>

<p>"I have wanted to know you boys for some
time," he began. "I have heard of you both,
as indeed the whole world has lately. It is a
pleasure to know such manly fellows, and
I want here personally to congratulate both
of you for your splendid work with this company
during the last month or so. I have
heard of your school and of your desire to
complete your education there, now that the
war has ended and you have served your
country so well. You are, indeed, a great
credit to Brighton Academy. This is not
said, my boys, by way of flattery, as I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
you are both too level-headed to be victims
of self-conceit. What I have to say is merely
in recognition of your good work, and is only
a deserved tribute."</p>

<p>The president took from his inner pocket
two long envelopes. One he handed to Dick;
the other to Jay.</p>

<p>"Take these, please, as a token of our
appreciation and an expression of our goodwill
and kindly interest in both of you.
Please do not open them until you have
withdrawn from this assemblage. It is not
possible to place a value upon what you have
done for us lately, but possibly this may
prove of some value to you in your plans
for pursuing your education to its completion.
With all my heart I wish you God-speed
wherever you go and whatever you do."</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the unexpected ovation,
the lads could only mumble their thanks as
they took the proffered envelopes and transferred
them to their own pockets. Deferentially
they bowed, while the little audience
grouped about them in the shipbuilders'
office applauded. And then President Walter
turned to the dog.</p>

<p>"It is a pleasure also to know this great
dog," he continued, stroking the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
hound. "He, too, is worthy of some special
recognition. To that end, gentlemen, I
desire to introduce Mr. Henry LeFevre, of
New York, representing the Society of the
Blue Cross."</p>

<p>Mr. LeFevre stepped forward and explained
about the organization that he represented;
how it was an international organization that
looked after the interests of animals, particularly
horses and dogs. Throughout the war
it had rendered valiant service on the battlefields
of Europe looking after the interests of
the Animal Kingdom.</p>

<p>"The brilliant work of this dog in rescuing
his master from Long Island Sound a few
weeks ago came to our attention," he told the
assemblage. "We decided that such a meritorious
act was deserving of fitting recognition.
So I am here this day personally to
greet Fismes the War Dog and his owners,
and to confer upon this splendid dog the
Blue Cross of our Society."</p>

<p>So saying, the speaker took from his pocket
a neat plush-lined box from which he lifted
the beautiful decoration of the Blue Cross.
He stooped to fasten it on the collar of Fismes,
but at this juncture Superintendent Brown
and Captain Austin stepped forward and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
suggested that the dog be placed on the big
mahogany table. Jay and Dick at once
lifted the hound to a place of honor amid the
plaudits of the crowd. Then, with a few
well chosen words, the decoration was affixed.</p>

<p>An impromptu reception followed the ceremony,
everybody crowding around to felicitate
the Brighton boys and to pet the big
hound on the table who stood patiently
taking it all in, alternately rubbing his nose
over the sleeves of Jay and Dick as they came
close to him.</p>

<p>"How much will you take for him?" asked
one of the guests, a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>Dick smiled. "I reckon he's not for sale
at any price," was his reply as he put one arm
around his protegée.</p>

<p>"That dog is going to school," remarked
Jay. "He's slated to enter Brighton with us
next month. He'll be the mascot of our
athletic teams; but all the time he'll be the
particular pal of chum and me. We have a
special reservation for him in the academy
stables."</p>

<p>Soon it was all over and the boys with their
pet had withdrawn. It had been somewhat
of an ordeal for the two modest youths, and
they were glad when it was all over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gee, I'd sooner be a prisoner in the
<i>Nautilus</i> any time than stand up under that
stuff," groaned Jay.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so," re-echoed Dick.</p>

<p>But the big surprise was still in store.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose is in here?" smiled
Jay, taking from his pocket the envelope
that President Walter had given him. Dick
followed suit.</p>

<p>"I have no idea; let's look."</p>

<p>They did. Imagine their joyful surprise
when they drew out a check on the Bridgeford
Salvage Company for one thousand dollars
each!</p>

<p>"G-o-o-d N-n-n-ight!" was all Jay could
say. As for Dick, he just whistled and passed
his hand over his face with a gesture of bewilderment.</p>

<p>One thousand dollars! It would permit
them to finish their courses at Brighton and
give them a good start on their college careers.
There it was in black and white on a note
that accompanied the checks:</p>

<p>"From the Bridgeford Salvage Company
as a testimonial of faithful and efficient service
in order that you may apply it to the
completion of your education."</p>

<p>Both boys were overwhelmed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
bonus. They had expected to be paid off at
the expiration of their contracts, according to
the terms of the agreement under which they
had been employed in June. This had
stipulated they would receive an additional
honorarium in the event the company was
successful in salvaging any treasure during the
summer. But this additional check for
$1000 was almost too good to believe.</p>

<p>"Now we can go right through to the
diploma at Brighton," chirruped Jay as he
danced around Fismes.</p>

<p>"And have some left for college," added
Dick.</p>

<p>Delighted, they ran straight home to
acquaint their families with the good news.
To have been so handsomely rewarded was
something they had never dreamed of. Now
they were certain to go through with their
cherished plans for an education that would
enable them to compete with the best brains
of the world.</p>

<p>A few days later the boys received a summons
to the office of "Montey" Brown again.
Their contracts ran on until September 10th,
and they were still subject to call.</p>

<p>They found Captain Austin and Superintendent
Brown awaiting them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you say, boys, to a little more
fun before you leave us?" asked "Montey."</p>

<p>"Good enough," replied Jay. To which
Dick added a "Fire away."</p>

<p>"All right," resumed the superintendent.
"You remember we didn't finish up the job
on the old <i>Dominion</i> off Martha's Vineyard.
Remember, we got most of the diamonds,
but left the gold bullion. Thousands of
dollars' worth of precious metal down there
yet."</p>

<p>"What we want to do is to go back there
and finish up the job while you boys are still
with us," "Montey" Brown was saying.
"We propose to use the <i>Jules Verne</i> and the
<i>Nautilus</i> this time instead of sending you
down as divers from the <i>Nemo</i>&mdash;that is, if
you are willing."</p>

<p>Were they willing? Sure they were, and
anxious to be off whenever the salvage ship
officials said the word. They said so, too,
in emphatic words that left no doubt as to
the fact that neither of the Brighton lads had
lost his nerve as a result of their experiences
of the summer.</p>

<p>"Let's go, men," Jay responded. "We
still have a few weeks of our contract time
left and nothing would suit us better than to
visit the old <i>Dominion</i> again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>That settled it. The boys were informed
the <i>Jules Verne</i> would sail the following
morning at sunrise and they would be counted
on to report in time for the sailing.</p>

<p>The <i>Jules Verne</i> and the <i>Nautilus</i> had been
completely repaired again after the breakdown
in Long Island Sound on the occasion
of the coal barge incident. Taken into drydock
and carefully examined, it had developed
that the <i>Nautilus</i> was intact, despite the
bomb explosion. None of her seams had
been strained and she had been fitted out
with new equipment that made a repetition
of the accident in which the two boys nearly
lost their lives next to an impossibility.</p>

<p>So, on the following morning, the Brighton
boys found themselves headed again out
Long Island Sound toward the Atlantic
Ocean and the new seat of action off Martha's
Vineyard.</p>

<p>"We'll have no Weddigen around this time
to ball things up or put any phoney stuff
across again," remarked Dick as they discussed
the work at hand.</p>

<p>That set them talking about Weddigen.
Not a trace of him had been found since his
escape from the Navy Yard at Boston,
although government secret service men had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
sought everywhere for him. But the boys
had heard from the Navy Department concerning
their exploit off Cape May in reclaiming
government plans and formulas from the
submerged U-boat. From the Secretary of
the Navy had come a letter congratulating
them for their service.</p>

<p>"I only wish Weddigen was here, though,"
said Jay. "I've got a score to settle with him,
and I'd enjoy nothing more than the chance
to turn him over to Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>"Some day we may meet up with him
again," returned Dick. "In that event we'll
see that he doesn't escape."</p>

<p>Through the day the <i>Jules Verne</i> made
her way slowly along. Because of the fact
that she was pushing the <i>Nautilus</i> along ahead
of her, navigation was necessarily slow. The
speed was no better then eight knots an
hour. It was nearly dusk when they arrived
in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard and
quite dark when they approached the spot
where the <i>Dominion</i> lay under many fathoms
of water.</p>

<p>Quite a stir was created aboard the <i>Jules
Verne</i> when Captain Austin reported that
another vessel of some kind had anchored for
the night in the immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"As near as I can estimate it, she is anchored
just about over the spot where lies the
<i>Dominion</i>," Captain Austin confided to the
Brighton boys as he climbed down from the
bridge of the <i>Jules Verne</i> and joined them on
deck.</p>

<p>What manner of craft was this? Who was
aboard her? And what was she doing here
in this neighborhood quite out of the path of
ocean travel?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XIX
<span class="ch">In the Pirates' Nest</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">PEERING through the darkness the new
arrivals on the <i>Jules Verne</i> could scarcely
make out the outlines of the other
craft. She seemed at first glance like a good-sized
sloop with a leg-of-mutton mainsail
that bellied wide against the night skyline.
And then again she appeared to be a huge
cabin cruiser. Lights appeared from a row
of ports well forward.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose it is?" asked Jay
as he edged up close to his captain.</p>

<p>"Likely an auxiliary craft of some kind&mdash;sail
and motor," replied the chief executive
of the <i>Jules Verne</i>.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the trio watched the
other vessel lying to only a few cable lengths
away. Captain Austin had a glass that he
trained on the stranger. But it was too dark
to get many details of her.</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose he is?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>Captain Austin shook his head. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was no way of telling. "Looks as though
some one had beat us to it," he mused.</p>

<p>"Do you reckon they have gotten down
into the <i>Dominion</i> and gotten up any of the
bullion?" queried Larry Seymour, who had
joined them.</p>

<p>"Indeed, son, I haven't the least idea,"
said the captain. "It does seem mighty
strange that some one else should have
anchored right in the vicinity of the <i>Dominion</i>.
Very few people know where the <i>Dominion</i>
lies, and if this chap doesn't know, it surely
is an odd coincidence that he should be
anchored for the night right where he is."</p>

<p>The engines of the <i>Jules Verne</i> were still
in motion. The anchors were just being run
out and it was not possible to hear distinctly
any noise that might have been wafted over
the waters from the mythical craft. Captain
Austin announced he would speak the vessel
as soon as the <i>Jules Verne</i> had settled for the
night and the engines had stopped. In the
meantime the crew indulged in all manner of
speculation.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is a United States revenue
cutter," offered Dick.</p>

<p>"Or one of the fishing fleet that has gotten
off her course and stopped here for the night,"
suggested Larry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Might be some millionaire's pleasure craft,
too," put in Captain Austin. "She looks
like a pretty swell boat, whatever she is.
What do you think, Mr. Thacker?"</p>

<p>The captain turned to Jay. That youth
slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm not a trouble-hunter, but my own
private opinion is that that ship over there,
whatever is she and whoever is aboard her,
is here for no good," replied Jay deliberately.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" began Dick.</p>

<p>"I mean that I think those fellows over
there right now are after the gold in the <i>Dominion</i>,"
interrupted Jay. "They may have been
here for days. They may have the <i>Dominion</i>
pretty well cleaned out, or they may have
just arrived. At any rate, my hunch is that
she is a treasure-hunter&mdash;a submarine pirate."</p>

<p>"How are we going to find out?" interrogated
Larry, very much aroused by the possibility
of encountering a pirate.</p>

<p>"Wait until morning, I reckon," answered
Jay.</p>

<p>Just then Captain Austin, who had moved
off during the conversation, came back. He
was carrying a megaphone.</p>

<p>"I am going to hail them," he announced.
The <i>Jules Verne</i> had been anchored and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
engines shut off. So the captain of the salvage
ship advanced to the rail and trained his
megaphone in the direction of the other ship.</p>

<p>"Hello! Who are you?" he bellowed,
slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>Eagerly the crowd waited. But no reply.
Again the captain shouted and still no
response. A third time he shouted, this time
in an even more imperative tone. And back
came an answer.</p>

<p>"None of your business who we are. Who
are you?"</p>

<p>If there had been any suspicion aboard
the <i>Jules Verne</i> as to the character of the
other ship, that answer settled it. Whoever
it was, he was not going to make himself
known. He was averse to disclosing his
identity and he wanted no interference, as
was manifested by his saucy answer.</p>

<p>In reply Captain Austin gave no information
to disclose his identity either. Instead
he yelled:</p>

<p>"Never mind who we are. You can find
out in the morning."</p>

<p>And in that same moment he resolved in
his mind that he would keep the stranger
well covered during the night and see that
no effort was made to escape. Turning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the rail, the captain immediately called his
executive officer and gave orders for the
crew to be armed with sidearms, that a sentry
with a rifle be posted to starboard on the side
facing the stranger craft, and that a machine
gun that the <i>Jules Verne</i> carried for just such
protection as might arise out of an emergency
of this kind be mounted on the bridge.</p>

<p>"Seymour, I want you to stand close by the
wireless tonight, for we might want you at
any time," the captain directed.</p>

<p>Officials of the salvage company had deemed
it wise to arm the <i>Jules Verne</i>; for, since her
fame as a salvage ship had gone abroad it was
possible that pirate ships might lay for her
and attempt to rob her. The wireless had
been installed also because virtually all sea-going
vessels were now so equipped. Larry
Seymour, who had been with the radio
service while in the army, had proved an
ideal man for the post of wireless operator
on the <i>Jules Verne</i>.</p>

<p>With these preparations complete Captain
Austin ordered all men below for evening
mess and called his two special divers, Jay
Thacker and Dick Monaghan, into his own
stateroom to have dinner with him. The
three sat down to eat and were soon engrossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in a deep discussion of the mysterious ship
that was their neighbor for the night.</p>

<p>"I'll say he has a nasty tongue in his head
to answer the way he did," said Jay. He was
ready for a fight; his blood was up.</p>

<p>"Mighty discourteous, to say the least,"
was the captain's comment.</p>

<p>They were agreed by now that the strange
craft had come to Martha's Vineyard with some
design rather than that she had accidentally
anchored for the night in the vicinity of the
submerged <i>Dominion</i>. But who she was and
who was aboard her was more than they could
surmise. Only daylight would reveal her&mdash;provided
she stayed that long. What was
to prevent her slipping away?</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do"&mdash;&mdash;Jay had
jumped from the table, overturning a plate
of food in his excitement.</p>

<p>"I'll go aboard her myself this very night.
I'll find out who she is and who is aboard her
and what they are doing. I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How will you go aboard her? Row over
in a small boat and take your chances on being
shot or done away with by a band of pirates?
Not if I have anything to say about it," said
Captain Austin firmly.</p>

<p>But Jay was insistent. Nothing would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
deter him, he said. He would swim. It was
the logical thing to do. If the ship were a
pirate craft they could take measures at once
to capture her or wireless for help.</p>

<p>"But you would be running quite a risk,"
offered the captain.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," rattled off Jay. "That would
be just a lark, and I am more than able to
take care of myself."</p>

<p>In the end the leader of the salvage crew
surrendered to his determined diver. It was
agreed they would wait until ten o'clock
when all was quiet and that no word should
be spread among the crew of the <i>Jules Verne</i>.
So while Captain Austin went off to inspect
the ship, and in particular the guard whom he
had posted, Jay repaired to his stateroom
and stretched out for a little rest. Dick was
with him and Fismes snoozed near the open
door.</p>

<p>"How many men do you suppose they have
on board over there?" queried Dick, pointing
in the direction of the unknown vessel.</p>

<p>"Goodness only knows; they may have a
dozen or fifty," said Jay. "She looks like a
pretty big boat as near as you can size her
up in the dark. If they came out here after
any of that gold you can make up your mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
they are well equipped to take care of themselves.
They have enough men to put up a
good fight and quite likely are as well armed
if not better than we are."</p>

<p>"What makes you think they are here after
the <i>Dominion's</i> gold? I thought only a few
people knew where the liner went down, let
alone that she carried such wealth," pondered
Dick.</p>

<p>"True enough," said Jay. "Not many
people do know where she is. But they could
find out. You remember that we were out
here once before on the <i>Dominion</i>. Possibly
some member of the crew of the <i>Nemo</i> has
spread the news."</p>

<p>Ten o'clock found Jay ready for the venture.
He had divested himself of all his
outer clothing and had resolved to make the
trip dressed only in a bathing suit. The night
was warm and the water just the temperature
for a cool swim. The youth went
unarmed.</p>

<p>"Just going out to reconnoiter a little bit,"
he had said. Jay's plan was to get aboard
the strange craft in some way, look her over
and report back his observations. What
they would be he had not the slightest idea.
His sole intent was to learn something about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the unfriendly ship that had refused to
divulge its identity and to bring back this
information to the <i>Jules Verne</i>. He resolved
to go unarmed, deciding not even to carry a
dirk in his belt, although Dick had suggested
that for the sake of self-protection in a possible
surprise attack.</p>

<p>"No, if the worst comes to the worst I'll
just jump overboard and get back here in a
jiffy," Jay had said.</p>

<p>Accompanied by his chum, Jay started
from his stateroom for the bridge, there to
consult a moment with Captain Austin before
leaving. On the way the two Brighton boys
dropped in on Larry Seymour in the wireless
room just to say "howdy."</p>

<p>"Good enough, fellows," said Larry, as
the two Brighton boys stepped into the wireless
station. "I've just been talking with a
revenue cutter&mdash;the <i>Marblehead</i>. She's
anchored for the night in a cove about five
miles around the bend of the coast line from
us."</p>

<p>"Fine!" exclaimed Jay, as he brought his
fist down on the table. And then he added:
"Tell him we might need his services around
here pretty shortly and to keep a sharp ear
out for us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've already done that much," smiled
back Larry, "and he's so inquisitive he wants
to know what's up. But I've told him
nothing more. He knows we are a salvage
ship and that we are always likely to be
mixing it up with some highway&mdash;I mean
high sea&mdash;robber."</p>

<p>"Good work," answered Jay. "And now
I'm off, fellows."</p>

<p>Jay ran off for a moment to speak to Captain
Austin and then came back to the rail,
where Dick and Larry awaited him.</p>

<p>"You all right, chum?" queried Dick
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Never felt better in my life," the other
answered. And then they shook hands all
around.</p>

<p>Jay waved a farewell and went over the
side on a tie rope. Soundlessly he slipped
into the water and straightway began to
swim. He had laid his course several times
during the evening and found it easy going
because the strange craft had dim lights
forward and aft. Jay's target lay directly
between.</p>

<p>Accustomed to the water, a stout swimmer
and in the best of condition, he made rapid
progress. The youth's chief concern was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
make no noise. By no means must he make
the slightest sound that would betray his
approach to any who might be watching
aboard the mystery ship. That some one
or perhaps many were on guard Jay felt only
too sure.</p>

<p>Here was a sure enough adventure! He
prided himself on the exploit. It was just
what suited his daring nature. Like Bainbridge
in the harbor at Tripoli, or Hobson at
Santiago! Jay remembered American naval
heroes who had performed spectacularly and
bravely for their country.</p>

<p>"This may not be war, but it's good live
stuff all right!" He chuckled to himself as
he swam stealthily along in the water, conserving
his energy in every possible way and
aiming true to his target.</p>

<p>Presently he came close up to the craft.
Yes, she was a palatial auxiliary, just as
Captain Austin had divined. Her sails were
furled by now and she was wrapped in a
mantle of darkness save for her signal lights
and a solitary light that twinkled from the
cabin ports well forward.</p>

<p>Jay swam closer. He was swimming slowly
with only his face out of water. What was
that just over the rail on a line with the main
mast? The youth turned smoothly on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
back and lay looking up on the deck of the
stranger craft. It was a guard! Jay could
see faintly the glow of a cigar and a moment
later heard the man clear his throat!</p>

<p>Immediately the Brighton youth swam in
close to the side of the vessel. There was
less chance of being seen. Quietly he set
his course toward the bow. Likely the guard
was only to starboard since that side was next
the <i>Jules Verne</i> in the near distance. Jay
resolved to go around to the port side and
take his chances there on getting aboard.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he swam quietly forward and
slipped around the bow of the mystery ship,
sliding in under her taut anchor chain. Once
on the port quarter, Jay worked his way
rapidly along looking for a line that might
lead aboard the vessel. What was his great
joy to find a rope ladder fully extended and
firmly held above.</p>

<p>It was only the work of a minute to draw
himself up, round over round. At the rail
he paused and surveyed the deck in both
directions. No one was in sight. Only from
the cabin forward came a murmur of voices.
The guard&mdash;if there was one&mdash;was to the far
side and apparently in ignorance of the fact
that a boarder had come over the side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Jay's mission was to find out something of
the craft and her crew. He resolved first to
take a peep into that lighted cabin. Forthwith
he directed his course in that direction,
keeping a sharp lookout on either side of him.
His presence so far was undiscovered.</p>

<p>In a few seconds he had arrived by the
nearest port. Now he must be careful,
indeed. Inch by inch he moved his head
along until one eye gazed through the glass.
And what a sight!</p>

<p>There in the cabin sat three men around a
table. Upon the table were laid a number
of bars of shining metal. Gold&mdash;the bullion,
at least a portion of it, from the <i>Dominion</i>!</p>

<p>The lad gasped. Here were pirates who
had discovered the <i>Dominion</i> and salvaged
some of her precious stores. But who were
these men? Jay could see the faces of two
of them. They were unfamiliar faces to him.
The third sat with his back to the Brighton
youth. But there was something about the
shape of the head, the contour of the shoulders
and the general physical build that was
familiar.</p>

<p>Who was he?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XX
<span class="ch">The Treasure Reclaimed</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">JUST then one of the trio stirred at the
table and Jay drew back hurriedly lest
his presence be noted. At the same time
the Brighton lad heard the guard moving on
the other side of the ship. It was time to
get out of here. And why not? He had
seen enough to acquaint him with the fact
that whoever these men were aboard this
palatial craft, they were pirates bold who had
filched from the <i>Dominion</i> some of her gold
bullion.</p>

<p>The lad hesitated not a moment, but quickly
ran back over the deck to the rope ladder
and as deftly lowered over the side. He had
come aboard all unsuspected and undetected.
Now he would hasten back to the <i>Jules Verne</i>
and tell Captain Austin all that he had seen.
It would be up to the chief officer of the
salvage ship to say what next should be done.</p>

<p>"They must not get away at all hazards,"
Jay told himself. He hated to go, for his
own disposition was to confront these chaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and demand of them by what right they
had helped themselves to the gold that reposed
here in American waters where only qualified
agents could search it out. But that, of
course, would have been foolhardy. The
only thing to do was to get back to the <i>Jules
Verne</i> and report his find.</p>

<p>The trip back was as easily negotiated as
the trip over. The distance was short, not
more than two hundred yards at most, and
the athletic diver found himself still strong
and sturdy as he came alongside the <i>Jules
Verne</i>. A low soft whistle brought Dick to
the rail in a hurry.</p>

<p>"That you, Jay?" came the friendly challenge.
To which Jay replied affirmatively,
and was quickly drawn aboard by the eager
hands of his friends.</p>

<p>"What luck?" asked Captain Austin, who
came up on the <i>qui vive</i>.</p>

<p>Jay motioned them all into his stateroom
and there, while Dick and Larry rubbed him
down and helped him into his clothes, Jay
told the whole story as rapidly as he could.
Captain Austin, Dick, Larry and Jay&mdash;these
composed the group&mdash;with the addition of
Fismes, who was snoring in one corner. Wide-eyed,
they sat hearing the whole narrative.
Patiently they heard him through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you recognize any of them at all?"
asked Captain Austin.</p>

<p>"No, not one, except that one looked
familiar," replied Jay. And then, in explicit
detail, he told of him who seemed to be the
leader of the trio in the cabin, who sat with
his back turned.</p>

<p>"I could not get a look at his face, but he
looked familiar to me and I've been trying to
place him in my memory," added the youth.</p>

<p>After deliberating for a time Captain Austin
decided to get in touch with the revenue
cutter <i>Marblehead</i> and tell them the whole
story. If the pirates decided to slip away in
the night the slow-going <i>Jules Verne</i> with her
diving bell, the <i>Nautilus</i>, could not pursue.
But the fast little revenue cutter could overhaul
them in a hurry.</p>

<p>Consequently, Larry Seymour repaired at
once to the wireless room and in a few minutes
was telling the whole story to the <i>Marblehead</i>.
For some time the wireless spat its messages
into the ether and then subsided as its receiver
got busy. Larry was transcribing the
messages.</p>

<p>"Captain Fowler, of the <i>Marblehead</i>, says
he will move up closer to us," said Larry.
"He wants us to keep a sharp lookout during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the night and apprise them of the slightest
movement aboard the pirate ship. If they
move at all the <i>Marblehead</i> will charge down
upon them. Captain Fowler proposes to go
aboard at daybreak and find out who they
are and by what authority they come taking
the gold from the <i>Dominion</i>."</p>

<p>"Tell him O. K. and to keep his wireless
receiver constantly on the alert," replied
Captain Austin.</p>

<p>In the meantime extra precautions were
taken to guard the pirates. An additional
guard was posted and both the powerful
searchlight and the machine gun on the bridge
of the <i>Jules Verne</i> were inspected to see that
they were in prime condition.</p>

<p>Captain Austin told Jay and Dick to turn
in; that he would call them on the slightest
provocation that their services were needed.
Jay, although a bit fatigued by his swim, was
for remaining up, but listened to the counsel
of his chum, and together they withdrew to
their stateroom.</p>

<p>"Might as well rest a bit, for there is bound
to be some excitement in the morning,"
advised Dick.</p>

<p>So they repaired to the quiet of their own
stateroom and with light extinguished lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
their bunks enjoying the cool night air that
was such a relief after the heat of the day.
From the corner came the gentle snores of
Fismes, who was curled up fast asleep and
entirely oblivious of the stirring events the
morrow might hold for his masters. And
pretty soon Jay and Dick, who had talked
for a long time there in the darkness of their
quarters fronting on the water about amidships,
lapsed into slumber.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was Dick who was first roused by a slight
noise outside the stateroom. Was he dreaming,
or had he heard a slight movement? The
youth stirred and raised himself on one elbow.
Did he imagine it, or was that the figure of a
man&mdash;a head silhouetted through the stateroom
window against the starry sky background?
He was minded on the moment to
cry out, demanding who was there. But he
kept silence.</p>

<p>Reaching quietly under his pillow he was
a bit dismayed to find his revolver not there
where he expected it. Then he remembered;
he had left it on the table. But he could not
reach it without getting out of his bunk. Jay
was still asleep.</p>

<p>How about Fismes? Funny the dog wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
be awake if some one was there. Dick listened
but could hear no gentle snore that would
indicate the dog was there as usual. Possibly
Fismes had gone out on deck or below. The
animal would prowl about at times.</p>

<p>Just then there was a slight stir again at
the window. This time there was no mistake&mdash;some
one was there. What Dick had
thought was a head moved slightly. And then
through the open door of the stateroom
appeared in firm outline the form of a man&mdash;a
huge hulk of a figure!</p>

<p>And then Dick did a funny thing. The
best course was to have kept silence until the
figure moved on. Then the Brighton youth
could have slipped out of bed, grabbed his
revolver and followed on. But he was not
sure in his drowsy condition whether it was
really a man, and whether it was friend or
enemy. It might be only the guard on patrol.</p>

<p>At any rate, Dick sat up in bed, reached
for the electric light and snapped on the light.
Instantly the intruder, who had been going
by the door, swung on his heel and thrust a
revolver through the open door.</p>

<p>"Not a word, or I'll blow your brains out,"
snapped the visitor.</p>

<p>Awakening with a start, Jay jumped up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
bed. The newcomer at once swung his
revolver to cover him.</p>

<p>"Throw up your hands, and don't say a
word," came the command. "If either of
you speak, it means death. Not only to you,
but to everybody on board. One sound and
I'll blow this"&mdash;he indicated a whistle tied
around his neck on a cord. "Your old boat is
well covered from the little ship over yonder.
We can blow you out of the water with one
little broadside and the world will never know
what became of you."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Jay as he sat
on the edge of his bunk with both hands up.
The youth was thinking rapidly. What
could he do, though, in the face of that ugly
looking revolver?</p>

<p>"Never mind who I am," came the reply.
"Your game is up. We have cleaned out the
<i>Dominion</i> of all her gold. Our ship is on
the move now. You will never know us nor
catch up to us. A little swim for me and then
into a fast motor launch that will take me
safely aboard my own ship. Do you get me?
The jig is up. You have come too late. The
<i>Dominion</i> has been cleaned as clean as a
whistle. Haw! Haw!"</p>

<p>He laughed softly. That laugh! Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
had Jay and Dick heard it before? Somewhere&mdash;this
man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They were both stirred by a quick command
from their visitor.</p>

<p>"I'll trouble you for the key to your stateroom,"
he was saying. "I'll have to lock you
both in until I get safely away. Come across,
quick."</p>

<p>Jay was inclined to parley, hoping to engage
the fellow until help came.</p>

<p>"Don't imagine it is so soft for you," he
sneered. "Just off the cove here lies a U. S.
revenue cutter. They know all about you.
I was aboard you myself to-night and saw
you getting your treasure together in the
cabin. We are equipped with wireless and
we have the revenue cutter <i>Marblehead</i> right
outside here waiting for you. You'll never
get away."</p>

<p>The muscles of the intruder's face contracted
at that, and his eyes bulged a bit at
Jay's startling declaration. And then his
finger sought the trigger of the revolver.</p>

<p>"If it were not for stirring up a fuss I'd
plug you both full of lead before I leave,"
hissed the figure in the doorway. "As it is,
you'll either give me the key to your stateroom
immediately or I'll shoot you both and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
then take my chances on getting away. Come
along smart now or I'll bore you both through
with this shooter."</p>

<p>And he took a new grip on the revolver as
he stepped menacingly forward.</p>

<p>But just then came an ominous growl on
deck just outside the stateroom. It disconcerted
the intruder for a second and he turned
his head slightly as there came another growl.
In that instant Dick leaped for his own
revolver as the lean figure of a stalwart hound
dog leaped through the air, launched fully and
fairly upon the giant in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Fismes!" yelled Jay. "Get him! Get
him!"</p>

<p>It needed no direction to tell this dog what
to do. With a malignant howl of hatred the
huge war dog dove for the body of the visitor
and sank his teeth in the flesh of the thigh.
Bang! went the revolver, but taken off his
balance by the unexpected flank attack, the
intruder shot harmlessly over the head of the
boys in the stateroom. At the same moment
Jay hurled himself in a flying tackle just as he
had flung himself at many a foe on the gridiron
at Brighton.</p>

<p>Down went the pirate leader. Jay's lightning-like
tackle cut both feet from under him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Before he could shoot again Dick leaped upon
him and wrested the revolver from his hand.
Against the infuriated dog and the combined
attack of two such sturdy youths as Jay
Thacker and Dick Monaghan he was outclassed.
The struggle was short and in the
end the prowling visitor lay panting and
helpless.</p>

<p>Outside came the tramp of many feet and
then the face of Captain Austin, Larry Seymour
and others of the crew who had heard
the shot and had been attracted by the commotion.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" demanded Austin
heatedly as he bent over the confused mass
of dog and men. It took only a glance to
show what had happened. Some one had
come slyly aboard the <i>Jules Verne</i> and had
been trapped in the stateroom of the Brighton
boys.</p>

<p>Jay and Dick struggled to their feet, relaxing
their hold now that help had arrived in overwhelming
numbers. But not so the dog.
Fismes held on as though his life depended on
it. With difficulty his masters succeeded in
getting him to let go the figure on the floor.</p>

<p>"Quick, captain," shouted Jay. "The
pirate ship over there is making ready to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
away. This chap came aboard here to see
who we were and to pay his compliments with
a bomb before he left. Quick! notify the
<i>Marblehead</i>."</p>

<p>Like a flash Larry was away to the wireless
to call the revenue cutter. Order followed
order as other members of the crew sprang
to the searchlight and turned its blazing rays
on the pirate craft. Others manned the
machine gun and stood by awaiting the order
to fire in case the ship so close by attempted
to move.</p>

<p>"Zzz-t-t-ttt!" the wireless snapped out its
radio call. Then the key was closed awaiting
the answer.</p>

<p>"<i>Marblehead</i> half a mile away only," reported
Larry as he came dashing back to the
stateroom. "She has seen our light and
knows right where we are. She has two
boatloads of armed men on the way now to
take the pirates in tow."</p>

<p>The figure on the floor stirred uneasily, torn
between the hurt of the wound where the dog
had sunk his sharp teeth into the flesh and
the despair of knowing that the game was
all up.</p>

<p>"Get up until we can take a look at you,"
commanded Captain Austin as he turned to
the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly the latter struggled to his feet. All
eyes were on him. Who was he?</p>

<p>Captain Austin turned the fellow with his
face full to the light. He moved closer and
gazed intently for a moment.</p>

<p>"Don't think you can fool me, you rascal.
Don't think I can't see through that disguise.
You have grown beard and moustache since
last we saw you. But I know you; and so
do these boys. Take a good look at him,
fellows&mdash;don't you recognize him?"</p>

<p>"Carl Weddigen!" gasped the boys almost
in unison.</p>

<p>"Just who he is!" affirmed Captain Austin.
"And believe me, he'll not get away this time."</p>

<p>They were fastening handcuffs on the prisoner
when the sound of rifle fire across the
water indicated the men of the revenue cutter
were boarding the pirate.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak large">CHAPTER XXI
<span class="ch">Back to Brighton</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SEVERAL days had elapsed since the
capture of the mysterious pirate ship
and her motley crew. The <i>Jules Verne</i>
had remained on the job at Martha's Vineyard
while her divers carefully combed the
interior of the old sunken British liner
<i>Dominion</i> to find whether any of the gold
bullion still remained in her hold. Relentless
search, however, had disclosed no more
of the precious booty&mdash;all of it had been
ferreted out by the arch-conspirator, Carl
Weddigen, diver extraordinary, adventurer,
spy and piratical chief. But all of it in turn
had been reclaimed from the interior of the
<i>Monterey</i>, the fast auxiliary that Weddigen
had commanded.</p>

<p>The fight on the <i>Monterey</i> had been short
and sweet. Taken unexpectedly by the surprise
attack of Captain Fowler and his men
from the U. S. revenue cutter <i>Marblehead</i>, the
men of the <i>Monterey</i>, deprived of the leadership
of Weddigen, who was a captive on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<i>Jules Verne</i>, had given up at the first show of
strength on the part of the government forces.
Two huge motor launches, armed with two-pounders
and machine guns, had come swooping
down upon the <i>Monterey</i>. Although the
crew of the <i>Monterey</i> were well armed with
modern rifles and ammunition, they had
hastily thrown down their arms at the first
withering fire from the launches of the <i>Marblehead</i>.
This fire had swept the decks of the
pirate craft, killing two of her crew and wounding
others.</p>

<p>Immediately the <i>Monterey</i> had been searched.
Just as Jay Thacker, diver aboard the <i>Jules
Verne</i>, had related to Captain Austin and to
Captain Fowler, of the <i>Marblehead</i>, the gold
bars&mdash;a dozen and more crates of them&mdash;had
been found aboard the pirate craft. Thousands
of dollars' worth of precious metal that
would have been spirited off by Weddigen
and his crew unless the resourceful salvagers
from Bridgeford had intervened.</p>

<p>"Lucky thing you called us in time," Captain
Fowler declared.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a lucky thing you were near,"
said Captain Austin. Which was true, indeed,
considering that the <i>Jules Verne</i> and her crew
could hardly have hoped to prevent the
escape of the pirates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>And then came the unfolding of the story
of Carl Weddigen. Yes, it was Carl himself;
the same ingenious plotter who had first
entered the service of the Bridgeford Salvage
Company with the idea of gaining information
as to where treasure ships were submerged;
the same intriguer who had hoped to profit
through his own thefts while ostensibly working
for Superintendent Brown and Captain
Austin; the same despicable traitor who had
been thwarted in the act of stealing valued
U. S. Government plans taken from the lost
U-boat at Cape May.</p>

<p>Carefully and noting every particular, Captain
Fowler, who was in fact a policeman of
the high seas, had heard from Captain Austin,
and from his star divers, Jay Thacker and
Dick Monaghan, the whole story of Carl
Weddigen. The Brighton boys started with
their first encounter with Carl in the plant of
the Bridgeford Company. They told of the
first experience on the <i>Dominion</i> when Carl
had been discovered in the act of secreting
diamonds in his diving suit, and how he
was compelled to disgorge through the
craftiness of Larry Seymour. The affair
off Cape May was related, and this was
the most damaging evidence, for it proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the fellow an enemy of the United States
Government.</p>

<p>"It surely will go hard with this chap after
we turn him over to the Department of Justice
at Washington," Captain Fowler had ventured
in an opinion on the future status of
the prisoner. For Carl was now a prisoner
aboard the <i>Marblehead</i>, closely confined under
constant guard in such a way that he could
not possibly escape.</p>

<p>At first Weddigen had been sullen and close-mouthed.
Repeated efforts to get him to
tell his story had failed; how he had fitted out
his pirate craft, where he had got the speedy
little vessel, and how he had shipped his crew;
and, finally, how he had cleaned out the
<i>Dominion</i>. But now that he had come to
realize that he was literally "up against it"
and that he was to be delivered over to the
United States Government to face a court trial
and possible death for espionage and high
crimes against the government, to say nothing
of his plots against the lives of the men of
the <i>Jules Verne</i>, the German prisoner had
decided to tell his own story in the hope that
it might in some way mitigate the whole case
against him.</p>

<p>And this was the story he had told: Following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
his escape from the Navy Yard at Boston
after the Cape May affair he had shipped
aboard a coastwise trader bound that same
day for Rio Janeiro. Going down the coast
he had ingratiated himself in the favor of
members of the crew by rescuing one of their
number who had gone overboard in a terrific
midsummer storm. The crew, most of them
Latin-Americans, had acclaimed Weddigen
their hero, and he at once assumed leadership
among them. One night he had confided to
some of them the story of the <i>Dominion</i> and
the gold bullion that still remained to be
taken from her hold. In awe and in envy
they had listened to the story. Their own
greed aroused, they had proved willing converts
to a plan to fit out an expedition and
go after the treasure.</p>

<p>On the day that the Brazilian merchantman
had touched at Vera Cruz for fresh
supplies the little band under Weddigen
deserted their ship and took refuge in the
Mexican city. From there they had worked
their way into the Tampico oil field region
and one night stole the handsome new twin-screw
auxiliary <i>Monterey</i>, the property of a
wealthy American oil magnate. Joined by
other confederates whom they had recruited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
among Mexican refugees and bandits, the
little party of adventurers had worked their
way out of the Tampico River into the Gulf
of Mexico, and thence up the Atlantic coast
to the little cove where the <i>Dominion</i> had
run aground, and where Weddigen had seen
enough while employed by the Bridgeford
Salvage Company to satisfy him that the
desperate effort in quest of the hidden treasure
would be well worth the effort, provided he
was successful. From a point near the scene
of operations the crafty skipper of the <i>Monterey</i>
had sent several of his crew ashore in a
powerful launch to bargain in a New England
seafaring town for a diver's modern outfit.</p>

<p>Uninterrupted in their quiet retreat, the
German and his Latin-American crew had
worked steadily in the reclamation of the gold
bullion in the hulk of the <i>Dominion</i>. Weddigen
had found among his crew one who
had had experience as a diver in the West
Indies, and they had worked in relays. Just
when they had completed their enormous
haul, on the very evening that the <i>Jules Verne</i>
had arrived, the pirates had completed rifling
the treasure ship. They had expected to sail
the following morning early for a South
American port, there to make away with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
their loot and dispose of their stolen ship.
Weddigen had seen the <i>Jules Verne</i> from his
vantage point within the cove long before
Captain Austin and his men knew of the
presence of another craft at the old anchorage.
But he had decided to wait until after midnight
and make a run for it in the darkness.
He had refused to answer the challenge of
Captain Austin, although he recognized the
voice of that official, hoping against hope he
might get away unrecognized.</p>

<p>Finally, when pressed for an explanation
as to why he had foolishly gone aboard the
<i>Jules Verne</i> in the early morning hours and
thus risked his chances of getting away at all
by putting himself in the way of capture,
Weddigen brazenly admitted he carried a
powerful bomb with which he hoped to sink
the salvage ship and her crew before they
could sound an alarm. But in this he had
been thwarted just as he was ready to set
the bomb and leave the <i>Jules Verne</i>. Loudly
the pirate chief had cursed the war dog
Fismes and the two Brighton youths who, he
said, had been his nemeses from the very
first day he had met them.</p>

<p>"Luckily for the United States Government
and all parties concerned with the ownership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of this gold bullion, there are such brave
youths as Mr. Thacker and Mr. Monaghan,"
the revenue cutter captain told him.</p>

<p>Thus had been accomplished the undoing
of Carl Weddigen. Now he was headed for
prison and a trial where he would have to
answer for all his crimes. The gold bullion
from the <i>Dominion</i> had been transferred from
the <i>Monterey</i> to the <i>Jules Verne</i>. Taking the
<i>Monterey</i> in tow, the <i>Marblehead</i> left on the
afternoon of the second day for Boston, while
the <i>Jules Verne</i> put back to Bridgeford.</p>

<p>On the deck of the latter, as the <i>Marblehead</i>
drew away from the cove in Martha's Vineyard,
stood two stalwart youths who had
played a stirring part in the drama that had
been staged. By their side sat a lean hound
with silken ears well set up and a silver-plated
collar that reflected the afternoon sun
with brilliant shafts of light.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like Treasure Cove, old
pal?" asked Dick of his chum. Treasure
Cove was the name they had dubbed the
inlet and bar where the <i>Dominion</i> had gone
ashore during war days.</p>

<p>"Fine, indeed," laughed Jay. "Even
though I nearly lost my life here earlier in
the summer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"And even though we both have been
having a nice little party with lots of gun
play these last few days," facetiously added
Dick.</p>

<p>"One thing about it&mdash;Weddigen saved us
all the work of digging up this gold out of
the <i>Dominion</i>," said Dick, with a whimsical
smile.</p>

<p>"And came near blowing us all to kingdom
come&mdash;would have done it sure as guns but
for Fismes here, who saved the day." Jay
took the nose of the big pet in his hands and
rubbed the dog's forehead while the animal
grunted in appreciation.</p>

<p>They discussed Weddigen again and agreed
he was just about the toughest customer they
had ever encountered. It was a satisfaction
to them to know that he had been apprehended,
and that they had played a signal
part in bringing him to bay.</p>

<p>After a time Jay said:</p>

<p>"Well, it's been a pretty nice summer after
all, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>Dick shook his head in emphatic approval.
He wouldn't have missed it for all the world,
he added.</p>

<p>"And likely to prove a very profitable
summer." This came from another voice
near at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brighton boys turned to greet their
captain.</p>

<p>"Likely to net you chaps a handsome
profit, indeed, after all this Treasure Cove
fight heaped up on top of your various other
exploits. I'll wager you it's a young fortune
you draw down at Bridgeford before you go
back to school."</p>

<p>"Perhaps more than we deserve," offered
Jay.</p>

<p>"More than you deserve?" Captain Austin's
voice rose to a high pitch. "You chaps
surely merit every single dollar that will be
paid to you. And it will be a good roll, my
boys. Just think of it. First of all, you
have the thousand dollars each that were
voted you by President Walter, of the Salvage
Company. Now you get a bonus on all the
treasure that we have reclaimed in addition
to the wage scale agreed upon in your contract.
On top of this is still another item."</p>

<p>Both boys looked up.</p>

<p>"Don't forget that the United States Government
offered a prize for the capture of Carl
Weddigen."</p>

<p>"But we didn't capture Weddigen&mdash;it was
Fismes," protested Jay in happy vein.</p>

<p>"All right then, have it your own way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Fismes gets the prize money from Uncle
Sam," laughed Captain Austin.</p>

<p>Arm in arm, the trio retreated from the
deck of the <i>Jules Verne</i> in quest of one good
square meal and a full night's sleep after
nearly a week of the merriest kind of adventure&mdash;actors
in a great game of treasure
hunting. Out on deck a brown-haired police
dog stretched himself luxuriously and nestled
his jaw into the embrace of two paws crossed
scissor-like.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In September, on a morning that dawned
in full autumnal splendor, two young men
stood on the station platform at Bridgeford
awaiting a train bound for New York. With
them were many friends, young and old,
including officials and employes from the big
shipbuilding yard. They had come to wish
a farewell to these two youths bound for
Winchester and the opening of the new school
year at Brighton Academy.</p>

<p>In the pocket of each youth reposed a bank
book showing healthy deposits to their credit.
More than six thousand dollars each in the
name of Jay Thacker and Richard Monaghan&mdash;this
from the Bridgeford Salvage Company
for the splendid work the young divers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
done throughout the summer! Enough to
carry each young man through preparatory
school and on into college!</p>

<p>"But those friendships are not counted in
terms of dollars and cents, are they, chum?"
said Dick Monaghan, with just a trace of a
lump in his throat as he indicated the group
of friends on the station platform. The train
was moving out. Larry Seymour&mdash;good old
Larry&mdash;had staged the farewell.</p>

<p>It might have been a cinder in Jay's eye;
at any rate, he was blinking hard as the train
gathered speed.</p>

<p>"You said a whole heaping mouthful that
time," replied Jay, trying to laugh off the
flood of emotion that welled up in him.</p>

<p>Up in the baggage coach ahead, a skinny
brown hound, accustomed to making the best
of every situation, winked at the baggage
agent and curled himself up for a snooze
and a dream of the new life to come at
Brighton Academy.</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
